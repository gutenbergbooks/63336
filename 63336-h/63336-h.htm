<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'>It is not only as having the Happiness to be
Your subject, that I beg Your permission to
lay this Book at Your feet. In whatever part
of the world I had been born, or had resided,
I should have desired to present it to Your
Majesty, as the Great Protector of the Reformed
Religion, and worthily filling that
Throne, which, above any in <i>Europe</i>, is the
chief Bulwark against the Papal Power, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_III'>III</span>its pernicious attendants. The wonderful rise,
and monstrous growth of that Power, almost to
the ruin of all true Religion, and all the Civil
rights of mankind, will be delineated in the
course of this Work, which I flatter myself may
be of some Use to the Protestant Cause. For,
next to the light of the Gospel, there is nothing
that Popery has more to fear, than that of historical
Truth: It is a test which the pretensions
and doctrines of <i>Rome</i> can never abide; and
therefore she has used her utmost endeavours,
not only to lock up the Gospel from the eyes
of the Laity, and prefer her own Comments, Decrees,
and Traditions, to the authority of the
Scriptures, but to corrupt, disguise, and falsify
History, in which necessary business her ablest
pens have been employed. To take off those
disguises, and discover those falsehoods, is consequently
a task becoming the zeal of a good
Protestant; and my intention at least, though
not my performance encourages me to hope for
Your Majesty’s Gracious Protection.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the latter part of this History I shall have
often the pleasure to shew, how great an Instrument
under <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> the Power and Strength of
this kingdom has been, to maintain and support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_IV'>IV</span>the Reformation all over <i>Europe</i>. But I must also
shew with concern, that from the death of our
wise Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, the Princes of the House
of <i>Stuart</i>, instead of pursuing that glorious Plan,
which she had traced out, were either remiss in
the cause, or wholly forsook it; so that had not
the Revolution providentially happened, and in
consequence of it, the House of <i>Brunswick</i> been
called to the Throne of these kingdoms, the
Reformed Religion would, in all probability,
have not only been lost in <i>Great Britain</i>, or at
least under a fate of severe persecution, but
would have been in great danger every-where
else, from such a change in the Balance of Power
as that event must have produced. The support
of Your Royal Family is therefore most necessary,
even upon motives of self-preservation, to
every Protestant both here and abroad. May a
due sense of that important connection between
Your safety and Theirs, be always kept alive in
their minds. May our Holy Religion continue
to flourish under Your Majesty’s Care, and that
of Your Royal Posterity, to the latest times.
May neither the open attacks, nor secret machinations
of <i>Rome</i> prevail against it. And may
it produce all the Fruits that ought to spring
from it, the truly-christian spirit of Toleration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_V'>V</span>universal charity, good morals, good learning,
freedom of thought, and candour of mind. I
need add no other wishes or prayers to these:
They comprehend all happiness to Your Majesty,
to Your Royal Family, and to my Country;
and they come from the heart of,</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE <br /> <span class='xlarge'>PREFACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_5 c014'>The Work, which I now offer to the Public, I undertook
some years since at <i>Rome</i>, and brought it down
to the Pontificate of <i>Victor</i>, that is, to the close of the
Second Century. As I was then a most zealous champion for the
Pope’s Supremacy, which was held as an article of Faith by the
body I belonged to, my chief design, when I engaged in such a
work, was, to ascertain that Supremacy, by shewing, century by
century, that, from the Apostles times to the present, it had ever
been acknowleged by the Catholic Church. But alas! I soon perceived,
that I had undertaken more than it was in my power to
perform. Nay, while, in order to support and maintain this cause,
I examined, with particular attention, the writings of the Apostles,
and of the many pious and learned men who had flourished in the
three first centuries of the church, I was so far from finding any
thing that seemed the least to countenance such a doctrine, that,
on the contrary, it appeared evident, beyond all dispute, that,
during the above-mentioned period of time, it had been utterly
unknown to the Christian world. In spite then of my endeavours
to the contrary, Reason getting the better of the strongest prejudices,
I began to look upon the Pope’s Supremacy, not only as a
prerogative quite chimerical, but as the most impudent attempt
that had ever been made: I say, in spite of my endeavours to the
contrary; for I was very unwilling to give up a point, upon which
I had been taught by <i>Bellarmine</i>, that <i>the whole of Christianity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>depended</i><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>; especially in a country, where a man cannot help being
afraid even of his own thoughts, since, upon the least suspicion
of his only calling in question any of the received opinions, he
may depend upon his being soon convinced by more cogent arguments,
than any in <i>Mood</i> and <i>Figure</i>. But great is the power of
truth; and at last it prevailed: I became a proselyte to the opinion
which I had proposed to confute; and sincerely abjured, in my
mind, that which I had ignorantly undertaken to defend.</p>

<p class='c001'>Being thus fully convinced, that the Pope’s so much boasted
Supremacy was a bold and ungodly usurpation, I could not help
censuring with myself the men of learning, who had countenanced
such a pretension, especially the two great champions of the Papal
power <i>Bellarmine</i> and <i>Baronius</i>. Did they not see what every man,
who but dips into the primitive writers, must see; what is obvious
to common sense? The poor shifts they are often put to, their
ridiculous evasions and cavils, their unmeaning distinctions, their
wresting several passages, contrary to the plain and natural meaning
of the authors they quote, and, above all, their unsatisfactory
answers to the objections of the adverse party, shew but too plainly,
that they wrote not from conviction, nor aimed at truth, but, perhaps,
at the <i>red Hat</i>, which was afterwards bestowed upon them,
as a reward for betraying the truth. Few have written in defence
of the Pope’s Supremacy, that have not been preferred; and none
perhaps who had not preferment in view. <i>Æneas Sylvius</i>, afterwards
<i>Pius</i> II. being asked, before he was raised to the Papal
Chair, How it happened, that, in all disputes between the Popes
and the Councils, many Divines sided with the former, and very
few with the latter? <i>Because the Popes</i>, answered he, <i>have benefices
to give, and the Councils have none</i>. Had he been asked the same
question after he was Pope, he would not perhaps have returned the
same answer; but said, upon his being put in mind of it, as <i>Gregory</i>
XIII. did afterwards on a like occasion, that, <i>being raised
higher, he saw better and farther</i>. Those therefore who have stood
up in defence of the liberty of the Church against Papal Usurpation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>cannot be supposed to have had any other inducement to
espouse the cause of truth, but truth itself. And this some have
had the Christian courage to do even in <i>Italy</i>, and almost in the
Pope’s hearing, at the peril of their liberty, of their lives, of all that
was dear to them; as I shall have occasion to shew hereafter. But
to return, in the mean time, to the present History: I no sooner
found myself in a Country where truth might be uttered without
danger, than I resolved to resume and pursue, in my native tongue,
as soon as I recovered the use of it, the work I had begun in a
foreign language. On the one side I saw the only obstruction to
an undertaking, which had already cost me no small pains and
labour, happily removed; while I flattered myself on the other,
that as a complete <cite>History of the Popes</cite> was still wanting, such a
performance might meet with a favourable reception from the
public. I am well apprised, that others have, at different times,
and in different languages, treated the same subject: but whether
any of their several works may deserve the name of a <i>complete</i>, or
even of a <i>tolerable History</i>, I leave those to judge who have perused
them; and shall only say in respect to myself; that, instead of diverting
me from undertaking the same province, they have more
than any thing else encouraged me to it. <i>Anastasius</i> and <i>Platina</i>,
the two <i>Classics</i>, as they are deemed, in this branch of History, have
indeed given us the <cite>Lives of the Popes</cite>, from the foundation of the
See of <i>Rome</i> to their times, but in so broken, imperfect, and unsatisfactory
a manner, that from them we learn but very little, even
concerning those of whom they have said most. It was not their
design to write a History, but only to draw, as it were in miniature,
the portraits of the <i>Roman</i> Bishops, by relating, in a summary way,
such of their actions, as appeared to them most worthy of being
recorded; and, to say the truth, they have both betrayed no less
want of discernment in chusing what they should relate, than of
exactness in relating what they had chosen.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Anastasius</i> the Monk, surnamed <i>Bibliothecarius</i>, that is, Library-keeper,
Secretary, and Chancellor of the Church of <i>Rome</i> (for all
these employments antiently centred in one person, and were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>comprised under the common name of <i>Bibliothecarius</i>) flourished
in the ninth century, under <i>Nicolas</i> I. <i>Adrian</i> II. and <i>John</i> VIII.
He wrote a succinct account of the Bishops, who governed the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, from St. <i>Peter</i> to <i>Nicolas</i> I. who died in 867.
But the memoirs he made use of were none of the best. In his
time the world was over-run with forged or corrupted Pontificals,
Martyrologies, Legends, <i>&amp;c.</i> which were then no less universally
received, than they have been since rejected by the learned of all
persuasions. However, that from these the <i>Bibliothecarian</i> borrowed
the greater part of his materials, at least for the six first centuries,
is but too apparent from his overlooking, nay, and often contradicting,
the unexceptionable testimonies of contemporary writers;
as will be seen in the sequel of the present History. As therefore
the records, which he copied, are so justly suspected, and his own
authority can be of no weight with respect to those distant times,
the reader must not be surprised to find, that, in this History, I
have paid no manner of regard to an author, who has been hitherto
blindly followed by those, who have written on the same subject.
There may indeed be some truth in what he relates; but his frequent
mistakes render that truth too precarious to be relied on, unless
confirmed by the concurring testimonies of other more credible
and less credulous authors. However, in the times less remote from
his own, I shall readily allow his authority its due weight; the
rather, as he seems not to have written with a design of imposing
upon others, but to have been imposed upon himself by frauds and
forgeries; for he wrote in an age, when the world lay involved in
the thickest mist of ignorance, when superstition and credulity
triumphed without controul, and spurious pieces, filled with idle
and improbable stories, had thrust every grave writer, nay, and
the Gospels themselves, out of doors.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Platina</i>, so called from the <i>Latin</i> name of <i>Piadena</i>, a village
in the <i>Cremonese</i>, the place of his nativity (for his true name was
<i>Battista</i>, or <i>Bartolomeo Sacchi</i>) flourished six hundred years after
<i>Anastasius</i>, that is, in the fifteenth century, under <i>Calixtus</i> III.
<i>Pius</i> II. <i>Paul</i> II. and <i>Sixtus</i> IV. Under <i>Pius</i> II. he was Secretary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>of the <i>Datary</i>, the office where vacant benefices are disposed of;
but, being dismissed by <i>Paul</i> II. tho’ he had purchased the place,
in the height of his resentment, he appealed to the <i>future Council</i>.
What he suffered under that Pope, first in prison, and afterwards
on the rack, we shall hear from himself, in a more proper place.
<i>Sixtus</i> IV. the successor of <i>Paul</i>, well apprised of his innocence,
took him into favour, and, having enlarged, endowed, and enriched
the <i>Vatican</i> library with a great number of valuable books, in different
languages, he committed the care of them to him. It was
probably at this time that he wrote, or rather transcribed, the Lives
of the Popes from St. <i>Peter</i>, whom he supposes the founder of that
See, to <i>Paul</i> II. who died in 1471. I say <i>transcribed</i>; for, if we
except the few Popes who lived in or near his own times, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Eugene</i> IV. <i>Nicolas</i> V. <i>Calixtus</i> III. <i>Pius</i> II. and <i>Paul</i> II. he copied,
almost verbatim, all he has said of the rest, only interweaving now
and then the profane history with the ecclesiastic<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The Lives
of the fourteen succeeding Popes, from <i>Paul</i> II. to <i>Pius</i> V. elected
in 1566. were compiled by <i>Onuphrius Panvinius</i>, of the <i>Augustin</i>
order, a man more commendable for his learning, than for his
candor and veracity. These are, as we may style them, the original
compilers of the Lives of the Popes: <i>Platina</i> adopted <i>Anastasius</i>’s
concise method of writing, and <i>Panvinius</i>, <i>Platina</i>’s, contenting
themselves with bare hints; and thereby putting their readers
to the trouble of consulting other writers, in order to gratify the
curiosity they had raised. <i>Much has been said of the Popes by other
Historians, but very little by their own</i>, as the learned <i>Pagi</i> observed,
after comparing the authors I have mentioned, with the contemporary
Historians of other nations. I might well add, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span><i>very little</i> they have said has been thought too much; whence
some of them, and <i>Platina</i> in particular, have been made, in all
their Editions since the middle of the sixteenth century, to speak
with more reserve, and to suppress or disguise some truths they had
formerly told.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for those who in later times have engaged in the same province,
we need only dip into their works to be satisfied, that to
search out truth was not their business. Some are all praise and
panegyric, others all satire and gall: some have made it their study
to excuse the worst of Popes, others to arraign the best. That
many of the Popes have been wicked men, abandonedly wicked, is
undeniable, notwithstanding the pains that have been taken to extenuate
their crimes; but neither are there wanting some good
men among them, of innocent lives, and unblemished characters,
whose only crime is their having been Popes; and to misrepresent
or misconstrue the virtuous actions of these, as some have done, is
no less blameable in an Historian, than to dissemble or gloss over
the criminal actions of the others. This partiality may be easily
accounted for with respect to one great period of the present History.
During the quarrels and wars between the Popes and Emperors,
which lasted many years, and occasioned, in seventy-eight
battles, the destruction of an infinite number of innocent people,
two powerful factions reigned, as is well known, both in <i>Germany</i>
and <i>Italy</i>, distinguished by the names of <i>Guelphs</i> and <i>Ghibbelines</i>;
the former being zealously attached to the Papal and the latter to
the Imperial interest. In the midst of these distractions few writers
stood neuter, but, siding, according to their different interests or
inclinations, with one party or the other, drew their pens, each
against the head of the party he opposed, with more rage than the
soldiers did their swords. And hence it is, that we find the same
facts related by contemporary authors with such different circumstances;
the same persons, the Emperors especially and the Popes,
painted in such different colours. Of this very few Writers in the
later times have been aware; and therefore have, as their bias led
them to favour one cause more than the other, adopted as undoubted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>truths the many groundless aspersions and undeserved
reproaches which party zeal had suggested to the <i>Ghibbelines</i> against
the Popes, or to the <i>Guelphs</i> against the Emperors. I wish I could
intirely clear an eminent <i>Italian</i> historian of our own times from
this imputation.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, after all, as it was not merely with a view to supply the
want of a complete History of the Popes, that I formerly undertook
so laborious a task; neither is it now with that view alone I
resume it. What I proposed to myself, when I first undertook it,
I have said already; but, being convinced that I laboured in vain,
and convinced by such evidence as the strongest prejudice could
not withstand, I thought it a duty owing to truth, to set it forth
to others in the same irresistible light; and to defend, at least with
as much zeal, the best of causes, as I had done the worst. A disloyal
subject, who had taken up arms against his lawful Sovereign, would
not be thought intirely to comply with his duty, by only laying
them down: he ought, if actuated by a true spirit of loyalty,
and truly convinced of the badness of his cause, to range himself
under the banners of his injured Lord, and devote to his service
and defence the sword he had drawn against him. By a like obligation,
a writer, who has, even ignorantly, combated truth, is
bound, not only to lay down his pen, as soon as he finds himself
engaged in a bad cause, but, when occasion offers, to turn
against error in favour of truth the very weapon he had employed
against truth in favour of error.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to give the reader some account of the History itself, and the
method I have pursued in delivering it: I have intituled it, <cite>The
History of the Popes</cite>; but might as well have styled it, <cite>The
History of Popery</cite>; since it not only contains an account of the
Lives and Actions of the Popes, but of every <i>Popish</i> tenet; when,
by whom, on what occasion, and to serve what purpose, each of
them was broached; those more especially which relate to the
Pope as <i>Christ’s Vicar upon earth</i>, as <i>the Supreme Head of the
Church</i>, as <i>an Infallible Guide to salvation</i>; for these are the prerogatives
he claims, as entailed upon, and inseparable from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span><i>Roman</i> See. But that no such doctrines were known in the first
and purest ages of Christianity; that the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> was then,
nay, and thought himself, upon the level with other Bishops; that
the Catholic Church acknowleged no power, authority, or jurisdiction
in the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, but what was common to him with
all other Bishops, will appear so plain from the following History,
that I can hardly conceive it possible for any man, however prejudiced
in favour of the <i>Papal Power</i>, and <i>Popish Religion</i>, to peruse
it without abjuring the one and the other: I am but too well apprised
of the strength of prejudice; but, strong as it is, it can
never be proof against plain matter of fact. For who can believe,
for instance, in the Pope’s Infallibility, who can help looking upon
such an article of belief as the grossest affront that ever was offered
to human understanding, when he reads of a <i>Liberius</i> admitting
and signing the <i>Arian</i> creed, or confession of faith, declared heretical
by all his Successors; of an <i>Honorius</i> condemned by the Fathers
of the sixth Oecumenical Council, as an <i>organ of the devil</i>,
for holding the heresy of the <i>Monothelites</i>; of <i>John</i> XXII. preaching
up and propagating, both by his Missionaries and his Legates
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a latere</i></span>, a doctrine, which he himself retracted on his death-bed;
of seven Popes<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> cursing and damning, in emulation of one anther,
all who denied a certain tenet<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, and another Pope<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> as
heartily cursing and damning all who maintained it, nay and
recurring to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ultima Ratio</i></span> of the later Popes, the <i>Fagot</i>, in order
to <i>root out of the Church</i> (these are his very words) <i>so pestilential,
<a id='corrviii.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='erroneeus'>erroneous</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_viii.26'><ins class='correction' title='erroneeus'>erroneous</ins></a></span>, heretical, and blasphemous a doctrine</i>? This occasioned
great scandal in the Church, insomuch that some even
took the liberty to represent to his Holiness, that the Decrees and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Constitutions of one Pope could not be reversed by another. The
Pope replied (and what other reply could he make?) <i>That they
were mistaken, since it might be proved by innumerable instances,
that what had been decreed wrong or amiss by one Pope or Council,
could be rectified and amended by another</i>. This answer silenced
them at once, says our Historian: And well it might; I am only
surprised, that the word <i>Infallibility</i> has ever been since heard of.
The <i>Franciscan</i> Friers, who had occasioned the dispute, <a id='corrix.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='paiddear'>paid dear</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_ix.8'><ins class='correction' title='paiddear'>paid dear</ins></a></span>
for it: As they continued to plead the Infallibility of seven Popes
against that of one, and obstinately adhered to their doctrine,
Pope <i>John</i>, losing all patience, ordered all to be burnt alive, who
did not receive his Constitution; which was done accordingly, and
many of those unhappy wretches chose rather to expire in the
flames than to yield. These remarkable transactions are related
by several contemporary writers of unquestionable authority, and
among the rest by <i>Nicolaus Eymericus</i>, who was Inquisitor of the
province of <i>Tarragon</i>, and has inserted them in his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Directorium
Inquisitorum</cite></span><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>. Other facts without number, of the same nature,
and alike irreconcileable with the other prerogatives claimed by the
Popes, as well as with the chief articles of the <i>Roman Catholic</i>
religion, will occur in this History, and all so well attested, that
nothing, I think, can withstand the force of Truth thus displayed.
Logical arguments and controversial reasoning cannot be well
adapted to every understanding, and therefore are not always
attended with the desired effect, however skilfully managed; but
historical facts lie level to the meanest capacities, and the consequences
thence deducible are to the meanest capacities plain and
obvious. It is true, the Sticklers for the See of <i>Rome</i> have endeavoured
to darken the clearest facts, since they could not deny
them, as being vouched by their own approved authors; but they
have done it in so aukward a manner, with such absurd, ridiculous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>and unintelligible interpretations, comments, distinctions,
<i>&amp;c.</i> that, were it not well known it was their interest to defend
that cause, one would be apt to think they intended rather to ridicule
than defend it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if the Popes were originally mere Bishops, upon the level
with other Bishops; if they had no power but what was common
to them with all other Bishops; by what means could they thus
exalt themselves above their Collegues, nay, <i>above all that is called
God</i>? What could induce their Collegues, and with them the
greater part of the <i>Christian</i> world, to acknowlege such an unheard-of
power, and submit to a yoke of all others the most heavy
and tyrannical? For an answer to these questions I refer the reader
to the following History, where he will find every branch of power,
authority, or jurisdiction claimed by the Popes, traced from its
first origin, and the various steps pointed out, by which they raised
themselves from the lowest beginnings to the highest pitch of greatness;
which is opening a school of the most refined policy, that
ever was known or practised upon earth. In this respect we must
own the Popes to have been, generally speaking, men of extraordinary
talents, the ablest Politicians we read of in History, Statesmen
fit to govern the world, and equal to the vast dominion they
grasped at; a Dominion over the Minds as well as the Bodies and
Estates of mankind; a Dominion, of all that ever were formed,
the most wide and extensive, as knowing no other Bounds but
those of the Earth; nay, and not even those, since these mighty
Princes claim to themselves all power in Heaven as well as in Earth,
all power over the Dead as well as the Living. To establish the
spiritual part of this wondrous Authority upon the Gospel of <i>Christ</i>,
which contradicts it in every line, was an undertaking of no little
difficulty, and that required no common skill: to establish the
temporal dominion without a fleet, without an army; to subject to
it not only the ignorant and superstitious multitude, but Kings
themselves, nay and to prevail upon them to employ both their
arms and their interest in promoting a power evidently derogatory
to and inconsistent with their own; was a work not to be accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>but by men of superior talents, thoroughly acquainted with
all the arts of insinuation and address, and steady in pursuing, by
the best concerted measures, the great point that they constantly
had in their view.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two things, however, concurred to facilitate, in some degree,
the establishing the one and the other; <i>viz.</i> the profound ignorance
of the times, and the matchless cunning of the persons employed by
the Popes as their Emissaries and Agents; without which helps no
imposture was ever carried on with success.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was in <i>the night, while men slept</i>, while the earth was overspread
with the darken night of ignorance, that <i>the enemy came,
and sowed his tares</i>. From the Beginning of the Seventh Century
to the time of the Reformation, Letters were utterly neglected;
and in proportion to that neglect, Credulity and Superstition, the
inseparable companions of Ignorance, prevailed among the Laity
even of the highest ranks: the little knowlege that still remained
(and very little did remain) was wholly confined to the Clergy,
chiefly to the Monks, men most zealously attached to the interest
of the Pope, as well knowing, that by promoting his interest, they
promoted at the same time their own. It was in this period of
time, in this long darkness of ignorance, credulity, and superstition,
that the Pope and his Agents introduced maxims and notions
concerning the Papal Prerogatives, very different from those which
the world had entertained to that time. In the beginning of the
Seventh Century, that is, in the year 606. Pope <i>Boniface</i> III. a
man of great address, having craftily insinuated himself into the
favour of <i>Phocas</i>, obtained of that Traitor and Murderer<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>, the
famous Rescript settling the Supremacy on the See of <i>Rome</i>, in opposition
to the claim of the Patriarch of <i>Constantinople</i>. As <i>Phocas</i>
bore an irreconcileable hatred to <i>Cyriacus</i>, who was then vested
with the Patriarchal dignity, he was the more easily prevailed upon
to decide the Controversy, which had already lasted a long time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>between the two Sees, in favour of the See of <i>Rome</i>. If this hatred
in the Usurper was owing to the zeal of <i>Cyriacus</i> in laying
before him the enormity of his crime, and exhorting him to repentance,
<i>Boniface</i>, nay and his predecessor St. <i>Gregory the Great</i><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>,
knew better how to make their court to men in power, than to take
the least notice of their sins, however public, or mention <i>Repentance</i>
in their hearing. Be that as it will, it is certain, that to this
monster of wickedness the Church of <i>Rome</i> owes her Supremacy.
And it was this Grant from <i>Phocas</i>, that more than any thing else
inspired the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> with pride and presumption; which
increasing as their power increased, they were carried by degrees to
all the excesses an unbounded ambition can suggest, when free from
all Curb of Conscience, Morality, and Religion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, after all, the Supremacy granted by <i>Phocas</i> was but a Supremacy
of Order and Dignity; it gave no <i>new</i> power to the
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, but only raised him above his Collegues, especially
his Rival, the Patriarch of <i>Constantinople</i>; and made him, as some
express it, <i>the First amongst his Equals</i>. But his Successors, thirsting
after power, and scorning to hold their dignity by so precarious
a tenure as the Emperor’s pleasure, which might hereafter revoke
the decision of <i>Phocas</i>, and give the Precedence in rank to <i>Constantinople</i>
instead of <i>Rome</i>, began to disown the favour they had
received, to set up for themselves, and to claim the Supremacy, as
inherent by Divine Right in their See, and derived from St. <i>Peter</i>,
as Chief of the Apostles, and Head of the Church. Thus was
the foundation of the Supremacy changed; and wisely changed,
according to the rules of human policy. The old foundation was
no-ways proportioned to the immense superstructure, which they
now began to design; since they could claim but very little power,
if any at all, in virtue of the Emperor’s Grant. But the new
foundation was capable of bearing whatever the most unbounded
and aspiring ambition could build on it. Besides, the Bishop of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span><i>Rome</i> could not challenge, by a Rescript of the <i>Roman</i> Emperor,
any Superiority over the Churches, that had no Dependence on the
<i>Roman</i> Empire. But a Supremacy, inherent by Divine Right in
the Papal Dignity, raised him at once above all the Bishops of the
Catholic Church. What therefore now remained was, to improve
this extensive Supremacy into a no less extensive Power and Jurisdiction.
And here no time was lost, many circumstances concurring
to promote and forward the execution of their attempt. Besides
the ignorance of the times, and the influence of the Monks,
which operated strongly in their behalf, the Princes of <i>Europe</i> were
quarrelling among themselves about the Western parts of the <i>Roman</i>
Empire, and all glad to purchase, at any rate, the friendship of
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who, after the famous Donation of <i>Pepin</i> in
754. had taken great state upon him, and bore a considerable sway
in all public affairs. As for the Bishops, and the rest of the Secular
Clergy, they looked upon the Pope, especially after he had
added the Sword to the Keys, as their protector and defender; and
were on that consideration disposed to concur in strengthening his
power, and rendering it formidable, tho’ at the expence of their
own; chusing rather to subject themselves to an Ecclesiastical master,
than to submit to the Civil authority. I might add, that some
now began to mind the Fleece more than the Flock; and with That
it was some time before the Popes thought it proper to meddle;
but, when they did, they soon retrieved, by the haste that they
made, the time they had lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet I do not believe, that they designed at first to run those
lengths, or carry the Papal Prerogative to that extravagant height
they afterwards did. The success, that attended them in the pursuit
of one claim, encouraged them to set up and pursue another.
Of this no one can doubt, who peruses with the least attention the
Records of those Ages, and compares the Popes in the beginning
of the Seventh Century with the Popes in the latter end of the
Eleventh. We shall find them, in the first-mentioned period of
time, submitting with all humility to Princes; claiming no kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>of authority or jurisdiction whatsoever but in virtue of the Canons
of Councils, or the Rescripts of Emperors; glorying, or pretending
to glory, in the humble title of <i>Servants of Servants</i>; acknowlegeing
themselves Subjects and Vassals of the Emperors, and patiently
waiting the will and pleasure of their liege Lords to take upon
them the Episcopal dignity, or exercise the functions of that office.
Such were the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> in the beginning of the Seventh
Century. How different from those in the latter end of the Eleventh!
They were then vested with the <i>Plenitude of all power</i>,
both Spiritual and Temporal; above Councils, and uncontrouled
by their Canons; the fountain of all pastoral jurisdiction and authority;
and, by Divine Sanction, impowered to enact, establish,
abrogate, suspend, all Ecclesiastical Laws and Constitutions: they
were then become <i>Lords and Masters</i>, the most haughty and imperious
Lords, the most severe Masters, mankind had ever groaned
under: they no more begged, but dispensed titles, boasting a
power of setting up Kings, and pulling them down at pleasure; of
calling them to an account, absolving their subjects from their
allegiance, divesting them of their dominions, and treating in
every respect as their slaves and vassals, those, whom one of their
best and greatest Predecessors<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> had acknowleged <i>superior to all
Men</i>, and thought himself <i>in duty bound to obey</i>. This <i>Plenitude
of power</i>, as they style it, was not acquired at once, but by degrees,
as I have observed above; some of the Popes being more, and some
less active, crafty, and aspiring. But what is very remarkable, of
the one hundred and fourteen between <i>Boniface</i> III. who laid the
foundation of the Papal grandeur, and <i>Gregory</i> VII. who raised it
to the highest pitch, not one ever lost an inch of ground his Predecessors
had gained. And thus, by constantly acquiring, and
never parting with what they had acquired, nay, and tying the
hands of their Successors by the irreversible entail of a Divine Right,
they became the sole Spiritual Lords, and had almost made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>themselves the greatest Temporal Lords of the whole Christian
world.</p>

<p class='c001'>But by what particular means they rose to such an height of
grandeur and majesty, by what artifices and subtle contrivances
they maintained what they had usurped, and strove to retrieve what
they had lost, when it pleased Divine Providence to check and restrain
within more narrow bounds their overgrown power, the
reader will learn from the following History. Some of the arts
they have made use of, are of the most refined, and some of the
blackest nature; and both I have endeavoured, in this work, to
set forth in their truest light, without disguise or exaggeration;
those more especially which the Popes and their Agents have formerly
employed, and still employ, to bring anew under their yoke,
such nations as have had the Christian courage to shake it off,
and assert that <i>Liberty, wherewith Christ hath made us free</i>. If I
shall be so happy as thereby to keep awake and alive, in the breast
of every true <i>Englishman</i>, that noble ardour, which has, on a late
occasion, exerted itself in so distinguished a manner; if it shall
please Heaven to second my Undertaking so far, as to alarm by it
those Protestants (I wish I might not say those <i>many</i> Protestants)
who are not aware of, nor sufficiently guarded against, the crafty
insinuations, the secret views and attempts of the Papal Emissaries;
I shall think the time and pains it has cost me abundantly paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am well apprised of the reception a work of this nature must
meet with, and of the treatment its author must expect, both at
home and abroad, from the Popish Zealots. But let them vent
their zeal in what manner they please, I shall neither answer nor
relent their reproaches and censures, however malignant and groundless:
nay, I shall hear them with as much pleasure and satisfaction
as I should the praises and commendations of others; it being no
less meritorious in a writer to have displeased the enemies of Truth,
than to have pleased the friends. And these, I flatter myself, will
find no great room for censure: it would grieve me if they should,
since I have done all that lay in my power to leave none. I have
advanced nothing for which I have not sufficient vouchers: and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>these I have taken care to quote in the margin, that the reader,
by recurring to the places pointed out in each author, may be convinced
of my sincerity and candor. I have always preferred the
contemporary writers, when equally credible, to those who wrote
after, tho’ not without taking notice of their disagreement; and
such as flourished nearest the times when the transactions happened,
which they relate, to those who lived at a greater distance. Pursuant
to this Rule, in delivering the Lives of the Bishops who
governed the Church of <i>Rome</i> during the First Ages of Christianity,
I have confined myself wholly to the Primitive writers, trusting
no Modern any farther, than as he wrote from the Antients. From
these there is no Appeal; it is by them, and them alone, that the
Papal Supremacy must stand or fall. If they have all conspired to
misrepresent the sense of the ages in which they lived (and it is
only by this hypothesis that the Supremacy can be supported), in
what other monuments shall we search for it?</p>

<p class='c001'>The Partiality, which I have so much complained of above in
the works of others, I have taken all possible care to avoid in my
own; checking the very first emotions of that zeal, which, on
my reflecting how long, and how grosly I had been imposed upon,
would, if not carefully watched, have proved as strong a biass in
me against the <i>Pope</i>, and the <i>Popish Religion</i>, as the opposite zeal
has proved for them in others. The vices and vicious actions of
the bad Popes I have not dissembled; but neither have I magnified
them: the virtues and commendable actions of the good Popes I
have neither lessened nor misconstrued; nay, I have more than
once justified the conduct and character of some pious men among
them, greatly injured by their own Historians, because they lived,
and suffered mankind to live, in peace; applying themselves solely,
as it became good Bishops, to the discharge of their Pastoral duty.
These their Historians have strangely misrepresented, measuring the
merit of each Pope by the great Things they atchieved, no matter
by what means, for the exaltation of their See; which, in other
terms, is measuring their Merit by their Pride and Ambition.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>The Length of this History requires, I presume, no Apology.
Every one knows, that the Popes acted, for several ages, as the
Umpires of <i>Europe</i>, or rather as the Sovereigns; several Princes
being actually their vassals, and the rest affecting to pay them the
same respect as if they were. This emboldened them to intermeddle
in the public affairs of each State and Kingdom; insomuch
that no remarkable event happened, no revolution, no change of
government or constitution, which they did not either promote or
oppose, as it suited their interest, with too many of them the only
standard of right and wrong; and their authority, through the
ignorance, credulity, and superstition of those unhappy times,
was, generally speaking, of such weight, as to turn the scale into
which it was thrown. Besides, they had, in every Kingdom and
Nation, their Legates or Vicars, who, together with the Clergy,
formed, as it were, a separate State, and one Kingdom or Empire
within another. These, at the instigation of the Popes, their
Lords and Masters, were constantly encroaching on the Civil Authority
and Jurisdiction, on the Rights of the People, and Prerogatives
of Princes. Hence arose innumerable Disputes, which, if
Princes did not comply with their demands, ended in Anathemas,
Interdicts, Civil Wars, Rebellions, private Assassinations, and public
Massacres. Those who are versed in the Histories of other Nations,
as well as in that of our own, and know what a considerable part
the detail of these fatal disputes takes up in the particular Histories
of each State and Kingdom, will not find fault with the Length of this,
which, if complete, and as such I offer it to the public, must comprise
them all. Besides, I have given a summary account of the many
Heresies that have sprung up in the Church; of the Councils that
have been held; of the religious and military Orders; of their
Founders, institutions, fundamental laws, <i>&amp;c.</i>; subjects all, in
some degree, connected with the History of the Popes.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not doubt, but this Work will meet with a favourable
Reception from <i>Protestants</i> of all denominations; such a Reception,
I mean, as is due to Truth. It will, I flatter myself, retard, at
least, the daily increase of the Papal interest in these happy Kingdoms.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>As for the <i>Roman Catholics</i> here, would they but lay aside
their prejudices, so far as to peruse it with the least degree of candor
and attention, I am confident Truth would exert its power
no less efficaciously upon some of them, than it has done upon
me. They cannot surely be more biassed in favour of the errors
they had been brought up in, than I was. In them Truth has but
one enemy to contend with, Education; in me it had two, Education
and Interest; and the latter is but too often the more powerful
of the two. What I forfeited by adhering to Truth, most of
the <i>Roman Catholics</i> in <i>England</i> well know; and I am very confident
none of them can say, that I have ever yet reaped, or sought
to reap, the least temporal benefit from it. If therefore the Power
of Truth, when duly displayed, is so great, as to triumph thus
over the combined force of Education and Interest, we may well
hope, that it will, at least in some, triumph over Education alone:
I most heartily wish it may in all.</p>

It is out of some Regard to an antient Tradition, that
I have placed St. <i>Peter</i> at the Head of the Bishops
of <i>Rome</i>, though I am well apprised, that this, like
most other Traditions, will hardly stand the Test of
a strict and impartial Examination. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>That St. Peter was<br/>ever at</i> Rome,<br/><i>known only by<br/>Tradition.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To avoid being
imposed upon, we ought to treat Tradition as we do
a notorious and known Lyer, to whom we give no Credit, unless
what he says is confirmed to us by some Person of undoubted Veracity.
If it is affirmed by him alone, we can at most but suspend our
Belief, not rejecting it as false, because a Lyer may sometimes speak
Truth; but we cannot, upon his bare Authority, admit it as true. Now
that St. <i>Peter</i> was at <i>Rome</i>, that he was Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, we are
told by Tradition alone, which, at the same time, tells us of so
many strange Circumstances attending his coming to that Metropolis,
his staying in it, his withdrawing from it, <i>&amp;c.</i> that, in the Opinion
of every unprejudiced Man, the Whole must favour strongly of Romance.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tradition not to be<br/>depended upon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Thus we are told, that St. <i>Peter</i> went to <i>Rome</i> chiefly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>oppose <i>Simon</i>, the celebrated Magician; that, at their first Interview,
at which <i>Nero</i> himself was present, he flew up into the Air, in the
Sight of the Emperor, and the whole City; but that the Devil, who had
thus raised him, struck with Dread and Terror at the Name of <i>Jesus</i>,
whom the Apostle invoked, let him fall to the Ground, by which
Fall he broke his Legs. Should you question the Truth of this Tradition
at <i>Rome</i>, they would shew you the Prints of St. <i>Peter</i>’s Knees
in the Stone, on which he kneeled on this Occasion, and another
Stone still dyed with the Blood of the Magician<a id='rN1' /><a href='#fN1' class='c015'><sup>[N1]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Fabulous Accounts<br/>of St.</i> Peter.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <i>Romans</i>, as we are told, highly incensed against him for
thus maiming, and bringing to Disgrace, one to whom they paid
divine Honours, vowed his Destruction; whereupon the Apostle
thought it adviseable to retire for a while from the City, and had already
reached the Gate, when, to his great Surprize, he met our Saviour
coming in, as he went out, who, upon St. <i>Peter</i>’s asking him
where he was going, returned this Answer, <i>I am going to</i> Rome <i>to
be crucified anew</i>: which, as St. <i>Peter</i> understood it, was upbraiding
him with his Flight; whereupon he turned back, and was soon after
seized by the provoked <i>Romans</i>, and, by an Order from the Emperor,
crucified. These, and a thousand like Stories, however fabulous and
romantic they may seem, we cannot, without great Incoherency, reject,
if we admit St. <i>Peter</i> to have been at <i>Rome</i>; since the Whole is
equally vouched by the same Authority, and has been upon the same
Authority equally believed by those, who are called in by the Advocates
for the See of <i>Rome</i>, to witness St. <i>Peter</i>’s having preached
the Gospel in that City. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The greatest Men<br/>imposed upon by<br/>false Traditions.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
These are <i>Arnobius</i><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a>, <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i><a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a>,

and, together with St. <i>Paul</i>, to have planted Christianity in that great
Metropolis of the World; but this they took upon Tradition, and consequently
their Authority is of no greater Weight than Tradition itself,
which had they duly examined, they would not perhaps have so readily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>pinned their Faith upon it. False and lying Traditions are of an
early Date, and the greatest Men have, out of a pious Credulity, suffered
themselves to be imposed upon by them. How many Traditions,
after having reigned for Ages without Controul, were upon the
Reformation, when Men took the Liberty to examine what they believed,
rejected by the Church, ashamed to own them, and degraded
into popular Errors! But that of St. <i>Peter</i>’s having been at <i>Rome</i>, and
the first Bishop of that City, was a Tradition of too great Consequence
not to be maintained at all Events, since upon that chiefly was founded
the Claim of his pretended Successors to an uncontrouled Authority,
and universal Jurisdiction; a Foundation infinitely too weak for such
an immense Superstructure.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>How little regard<br/>paid to them by<br/>some Popes.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And here I cannot help observing the little Regard that the Popes
themselves have shewn to Tradition, though received by the greatest
Lights of the Church, when it did not promote the Honour or Interest
of their See. Of this we have a glaring Instance in a parallel
Case; for as St. <i>Peter</i>, according to Tradition, travelled to <i>Rome</i>,
so did St. <i>Paul</i>, according to Tradition, travel into <i>Spain</i>: the former
Tradition was received by the Writers I have quoted above, and
the latter by some of the same Writers, <i>viz.</i> by <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i><a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a>,
and <i>Jerom</i><a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a>, and by <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, <i>Chrysostom</i><a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a>, <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a>,
<i>Gregory the Great</i><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a>, and many others; yet such a Tradition was
rejected, perhaps justly, by Pope <i>Innocent</i> I. who would not allow
St. <i>Paul</i> to have ever been in <i>Spain</i><a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a>. Have we not an equal Right
to question, or even to deny, St. <i>Peter</i>’s having ever been at <i>Rome</i>?
Are not the Authorities at least equal on both Sides? Why then must
the Travels of one Apostle be looked upon as an Article of Faith,
and those of the other be deemed fabulous?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>No Mention in the<br/>Scripture of St.</i><br/>Peter<i>’s having ever<br/>been at</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>And truly, if we examine narrowly into this matter, the former
Tradition will appear no less groundless to us, than the latter did to
that Pope: for, in the first place, neither St. <i>Peter</i> himself, nor any
of the Sacred Writers, give us the least Hint or Intimation of his
having ever been at <i>Rome</i>. We are told of his being at <i>Antioch</i>,
at <i>Jerusalem</i>, at <i>Corinth</i>, at <i>Babylon</i><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a>; but of the great Metropolis
of the Empire, where he is supposed to have fixed his See, not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>least Mention is made. And may we not from that Silence question,
to say no more, his having ever been there? I know that by <i>Babylon</i>,
from whence St. <i>Peter</i> wrote his first Epistle<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a>, <i>Eusebius</i>,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> <i>Jerom</i><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a>,
the Venerable <i>Bede</i><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a>, <i>Oecumenius</i><a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a>, and <i>Grotius</i><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a>, understood
<i>Rome</i>; but this is a bare Conjecture, and no better grounded
than that of others, who thought that by <i>Babylon</i> was meant <i>Jerusalem</i><a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.
The learned Doctor <i>Pearson</i>, Bishop of <i>Chester</i>, seeing no
Occasion here to recur to a figurative Sense, is of Opinion, that the
above-mentioned Epistle was written not from <i>Babylon</i> in <i>Chaldæa</i>,
which then lay in Ruins, but from <i>Babylon</i> in <i>Egypt</i>; and no Man
has taken more Pains to make the World believe, that St. <i>Peter</i>
preached at <i>Rome</i>, and founded that See<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a>. But, in this Controversy,
the Silence of St. <i>Paul</i> in particular, if duly attended to, must be
thought, by every unbiassed Man, a far more convincing Proof of
St. <i>Peter</i>’s not having been at <i>Rome</i>, than all the Authorities that
have been yet alleged, are of his having been there.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St.</i> Paul, <i>in the<br/>many Letters he<br/>wrote from</i> Rome,<br/><i>never mentions<br/>St.</i> Peter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For that Apostle,
while at <i>Rome</i>, had frequent Opportunities of mentioning his
fellow Apostle, and fellow Labourer; and yet, naming several others,
he is quite silent as to him. From <i>Rome</i> he wrote to the <i>Galatians</i>,
to the <i>Ephesians</i>, to the <i>Philippians</i>, to the <i>Colossians</i>, to <i>Timothy</i>,
and to <i>Philemon</i>, without ever mentioning <i>Peter</i>, or sending any
Salutation from him; nay, it is certain, that St. <i>Peter</i> was not at
<i>Rome</i> when the Apostle of the Gentiles wrote to the <i>Colossians</i>; for,
mentioning <i>Tychicus</i>, <i>Onesimus</i>, <i>Aristarchus</i>, <i>Marcus</i>, and <i>Justus</i>, he
adds, <i>These alone, my Fellow-workers unto the Kingdom of God,
who have been a Comfort unto me</i><a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a>. <i>Peter</i> was not there, when
St. <i>Paul</i> wrote his second Epistle to <i>Timothy</i>, where he says, <i>At my
first Answer no Man stood with me, but all Men forsook me</i><a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a>: nor
was he there immediately before St. <i>Paul</i>’s Death, when <i>the Time
of his Departure was at hand</i>; for he tells <i>Timothy</i>, that <i>all the
Brethren did salute him</i>; and, naming <i>Eubulus</i>, <i>Pudens</i>, <i>Linus</i>, and
<i>Claudia</i><a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a>, he omits <i>Peter</i>, whom we may thence conclude not to
have been there. And yet it is a received Tradition in the Church
of <i>Rome</i>, that St. <i>Peter</i> was then not only in that Metropolis, but
confined and bound in the same Prison with St. <i>Paul</i>. As that Apostle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>in writing from <i>Rome</i>, sends no Salutations from <i>Peter</i>, so in
writing to <i>Rome</i> he greets many others, but never mentions him<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a>.
Now who would not sooner chuse to reject such Traditions, than to
suppose St. <i>Paul</i> guilty of such an unfriendly and unaccountable
Omission?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St</i>. Peter, <i>though at</i><br/>Rome, <i>not Bishop<br/>of</i> Rome.></div>

<p class='c001'>From what has been hitherto said, every impartial Judge must
conclude, that it is, at least, very much to be doubted whether St.
<i>Peter</i> was ever at <i>Rome</i>; but, allowing him to have been there, it
still remains to be proved, that he was Bishop of that See. This the
Sticklers for the Papal Authority spare no Pains to make out, being
well apprised, that the Whole of their Cause lies here at stake; and
yet I find nothing alleged by them in so material a Point, but a
few misinterpreted Passages out of the Ecclesiastical Writers: for the
right understanding of which it is to be observed, that such of the
Antients as called <i>Peter</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Rome</i> the <i>Place</i>, the
<i>Chair</i>, the <i>See</i> of <i>Peter</i>, meant no more than that he was Superintendent
of that Church, that he founded it by converting Men to
the Faith, and erected the Episcopal Chair, by appointing the first
Bishops. That this was their true Meaning, is apparent from what
we read in <i>Ruffinus</i>; who, having mentioned <i>Linus</i>, <i>Cletus</i>, and
<i>Clemens</i>, as succeeding each other in the See of <i>Rome</i>, while <i>Peter</i>
was still alive, thus accounts for their Episcopacy: They were, says
he, appointed Bishops by <i>Peter</i>, to the end that, they taking upon
them the Episcopal Charge, he might be at Leisure to discharge the
Duties of his Apostolical Office. And this, he tells us, was not a
Notion of his own, but the common Opinion<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a>. <i>Irenæus</i> speaks to
the same Purpose: <i>The Apostles</i>, says he, <i>founding that Church,
delivered the Episcopal Office into the Hands of</i> Linus<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a>. Hence the
most antient Writers, who lived nearest the Fountain of Tradition,
never stile St. <i>Peter</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, but only say, that, by ordaining
Bishops, he founded that Church<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>In what sense<br/>St.</i> Peter <i>and<br/>St</i>. Paul <i>stiled<br/>Bishops of</i><br/>Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> St. <i>Peter</i> therefore was not
Bishop of <i>Rome</i> in the strict Sense, to which that Word is now confined,
but in the more large Sense, of which I have taken notice
above: and in that St. <i>Paul</i> has as good a Claim to the high-sounding
Titles of <i>Pope</i>, <i>Bishop of</i> Rome, <i>&amp;c.</i> as St. <i>Peter</i>, since, together
with him, he is said to have founded that Church. The Popes
indeed will not allow him that Honour, nor condescend to reckon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>him among their Predecessors; but <i>Epiphanius</i> and <i>Eusebius</i> have
been more complaisant; of whom the former says, Peter <i>and</i> Paul
<i>were the first at</i> Rome, <i>both Bishops and Apostles</i><a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a>; and the latter
speaking of the Succession of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, Alexander <i>derived
his Succession in the fifth Place from</i> Peter <i>and</i> Paul<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a>. Both
therefore were Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, or neither; both in the Sense of the
antient Writers, but neither in that, which is now annexed to the
Word <i>Bishop</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Duties of a<br/>Bishop and an<br/>Apostle incon-<br/>sistent.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  And truly the Office of an Apostle, and that of a
Bishop, as the Word is now understood, are incompatible. An Apostle,
says <i>Chrysostom</i><a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a>, is charged with the Instruction not of any particular
Nation or City, but of the whole World; but a Bishop must
reside, says the same Writer<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a>, and be employed in one Place: and
therefore St. <i>Peter</i>, who knew these two Duties to be inconsistent,
if he was ever at <i>Rome</i>, committed there, as he did in other Places,
the Episcopal Charge to others, and pursued his Apostolical Office,
which required a more extensive Care.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Whether</i> James <i>the<br/>Apostle was Bishop<br/>of</i> Jerusalem.</div>

<p class='c001'>But St. <i>James</i>, say the Popish Writers, though an Apostle, was
appointed Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>; and why might not St. <i>Peter</i>, though
an Apostle, undertake the Episcopacy of <i>Rome</i>? It is surprising they
should lay so much Stress as they do on this Objection, since they
must know it to be grounded on an Uncertainty; as <i>Eusebius</i> the
greatest Antiquary of former Times<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a>, <i>Hegesippus</i> the most antient
Historian<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a>, <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a>, <i>Jerom</i><a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> <i>Gregory of Nysse</i><a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a>, <i>Chrysostom</i><a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a>,
and many others, reckon <i>James</i> Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, not among the
<i>Apostles</i>, but the Seventy Disciples. Of the same Opinion among
the Moderns, are <i>Grotius</i><a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a>, Dr. <i>Hammond</i><a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a>, <i>Valesius</i><a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a>, <i>Blondel</i><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a>,
and <i>Salmasius</i><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a>. The last of these saying, after his positive and confident
manner, <i>It is certain that he was not one of the Twelve</i>,
I may at least say, it is not certain that he was; and consequently
the Objection can be of no considerable Weight. But allowing him
to have been one of the Twelve, as some of the Antients seem to
think<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a>, there was a special Reason, why one of the Apostles should
be appointed to reside at <i>Jerusalem</i>, that City being the Metropolis,
the Fountain, the Centre of the Christian Religion; our Faith had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>there had its Birth; the Church was there very numerous, consisting
of many Thousands of believing <i>Jews</i><a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a>; and thither resorted great
Numbers of those of that Nation, who were converted to Christ in
other Countries. On these Considerations it might seem expedient,
that a Person of the greatest Authority should preside there. But
there was no special Reason why an Apostle should constantly reside
at any other Place, nor does it appear that any did: St. <i>Peter</i> especially
could not reside at any one Place, since to him, as <i>the Apostle
of the Circumcision</i>, was committed the Charge of converting the
dispersed <i>Jews</i> in all Parts of the World.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>What meant by<br/>the</i> Apostolic See,<br/>Chair, Throne, <i>&amp;c.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Appellations of the <i>Apostolic See</i>, <i>Chair</i>, <i>Throne</i>, &amp;c.
given by the Antients to the See of <i>Rome</i>, they import no more
than that it was erected by an Apostle; for they are bestowed indiscriminately
on all the Sees, in which Bishops had been placed by the
Apostles; <i>viz.</i> of <i>Ephesus</i><a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, of <i>Smyrna</i><a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a>, of <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a>, of <i>Corinth</i>,
<i>Thessalonica</i>, <i>Philippi</i><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a>, &amp;c. The Title of <i>Apostolic See</i>, common
to many, was, in Process of Time, by the Ambition of the
Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, appropriated to their own. They had, as they
thought, till the Year 1662. a pregnant Proof not only of St. <i>Peter</i>’s
erecting their Chair, but of his sitting in it himself; for till that
Year, the very Chair, on which they believed, or would make others
believe, he had sat, was shewn and exposed to public Adoration on
the 18th of <i>January</i>, the Festival of the said Chair. But while it was
cleaning, in order to be set up in some conspicuous Place of the
<i>Vatican</i>, the Twelve Labours of <i>Hercules</i> unluckily appeared engraved
on it. Our Worship however, says <i>Giacomo Bartolini</i>, who
was present at this Discovery, and relates it, was not misplaced, since
it was not to the Wood we paid it; but to the Prince of the Apostles
St. <i>Peter</i><a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a>. An Author of no mean Character, unwilling to
give up the holy Chair, even after this Discovery, as having a Place
and a peculiar Solemnity among the other Saints, has attempted to
explain the Labours of <i>Hercules</i> in a mystical Sense, as Emblems representing
the future Exploits of the <i>Popes</i><a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a>. But the ridiculous and
distorted Conceits of that Writer are not worthy our Notice, tho’ by
<i>Clement</i> X. they were judged not unworthy of a Reward.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St.</i> Peter <i>how, or<br/>by whom, placed<br/>in the See of</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>But to return to our Subject; it may be inquired, If St. <i>Peter</i>
was Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who placed him in that See? Did our Lord appoint
him? Did the Apostles name him? Did the People chuse him?
Did he assume it himself? To these Queries no Answers have been
yet given, but such as are so ridiculously weak, that it is not worth my
while to relate them, nor the Reader’s to hear them. <i>Bellarmine</i>,
in one Place, positively affirms, that <i>God commanded St</i>. Peter <i>to fix
his See at</i> Rome<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a>; but elsewhere contents himself with saying, <i>It
is not improbable that God commanded St.</i> Peter <i>to fix his See at</i>
Rome<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a>. Is it is no more than not improbable, it is uncertain; it may
be a mere Conjecture, a Dream.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Other Bishops of</i><br/>Rome <i>appointed<br/>by St.</i> Peter.</div>

<p class='c001'>St. <i>Peter</i>, either alone, or jointly with St. <i>Paul</i>, as we read in
<i>Irenæus</i>, and in the Apostolical Constitutions<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a>, appointed other Bishops
of <i>Rome</i>. Now, when he appointed others, did he resign his
Episcopacy, or retain it? If he resigned it, he did not die Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>; which shakes the very Foundation of the Pope’s Claim to
Supremacy: if he retained it, there were Two Bishops on the same
See at one time; which Pope <i>Innocent</i> I. in his Epistle to the Clergy
and People of <i>Constantinople</i>, condemned as an Irregularity never
known till his Time<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a>: he did not, it seems, recollect that it had
been practised by his Predecessor Pope <i>Peter</i>. <i>Theodoret</i> tells us, in
his Ecclesiastical History, that when the Emperor <i>Constantius</i> would
have had <i>Felix</i> to sit in the See of <i>Rome</i>, together with <i>Liberius</i>,
upon the Return of the latter from Banishment, the People of <i>Rome</i>
would not content to it, crying out, <i>One God, one Christ, one Bishop</i>.
<i>Felix</i> died soon after, and upon his Death <i>Theodoret</i> makes
the following Remark: <i>It was</i>, says he, <i>a special Providence, that</i>
Peter<i>’s Throne might not suffer Infamy, being held by Two Prelates</i><a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a>.
He did not consider, or rather did not believe, that it had been held
by St. <i>Peter</i> and St. <i>Paul</i>, by St. <i>Pater</i> and by <i>Linus</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St.</i> Peter <i>Bishop at</i><br/>Rome, <i>not of</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>To conclude, St. <i>Peter</i> was perhaps Bishop at <i>Rome</i>, not of <i>Rome</i><a id='rN2' /><a href='#fN2' class='c015'><sup>[N2]</sup></a>.
He was Bishop at <i>Rome</i>, if he ever was there, being, in virtue of his
Apostleship, impowered to discharge, at <i>Rome</i>, and every-where else,
all Episcopal Functions; but was not specially Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, or
any other Place; that is, he did not take upon him the Charge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>any particular Bishop, the Administration of any particular Bishoprick,
that being inconsistent both with the Dignity and Office of an Apostle,
or universal Bishop.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_1_0 c009'>There is a great Disagreement among the Antients about the
first Bishops of <i>Rome</i>: <i>Tertullian</i> makes <i>Clement</i>, whom he
supposes to have been ordained by St. <i>Peter</i>, the immediate <i>Successor
of that Apostle</i><a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a>. He was followed therein by <i>Ruffinus</i><a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a>, and
<i>Ruffinus</i> by the <i>Latins</i> in general; among whom that Opinion universally
prevailed towards the End of the Fourth Century. But <i>Jerom</i>,
rejecting the Opinion of the <i>Latins</i>, places <i>Linus</i> immediately
after the Apostles, <i>Anacletus</i> next to him, and <i>Clement</i> in the third
Place<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. His Opinion is supported by the Authority of <i>Irenæus</i><a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a>,
<i>Eusebius</i><a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a>, <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a>, and likewise of <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a>, <i>Optatus Milevitanus</i><a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a>,
and St. <i>Augustin</i><a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a>, with this Difference, that <i>Epiphanius</i>
gives the Name of <i>Cletus</i> to the Successor of <i>Linus</i>, and both <i>Optatus</i>
and St. <i>Augustin</i> place him after <i>Clement</i>; but in this they all
agree, that <i>Linus</i> was the first, after the Apostles, who governed the
Church of <i>Rome</i>. To the Authority of these Writers I may add
that of the Apostolic Constitutions, telling us, in express Terms, that
<i>Linus</i> was ordained Bishop of <i>Rome</i> by St. <i>Paul</i><a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Whether</i> Clement<br/><i>appointed by St.</i><br/>Peter <i>to succeed him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As to what we
read in <i>Tertullian</i> and <i>Ruffinus</i>, <i>viz.</i> that <i>Clement</i> was ordained by
St. <i>Peter</i>, and named to succeed him; Dr. <i>Hammond</i> answers, That
<i>Clement</i> governed with Episcopal Power and Jurisdiction the converted
<i>Jews</i>, while <i>Linus</i> and <i>Anacletus</i> governed, with the same
Power, the converted Gentiles. He adds, That, upon the Death of
<i>Anacletus</i>, both Churches were united under him<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a>. Thus he strives
to reconcile the Opinion of the <i>Latins</i>, placing <i>Clement</i> immediately
after the Apostles, with that of the <i>Greeks</i>, allowing him only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the third Place: for, granting what he advances to be true, and Reasons
are not wanting to support it, <i>Clement</i> was, agreeably to the
Opinion of the <i>Latins</i>, the immediate Successor of the Apostles, with
respect to the <i>Jews</i>; but, with respect to the Gentiles, he succeeded
<i>Anacletus</i>, agreeably to the Opinion of the <i>Greeks</i><a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a>. This Answer
<i>Cotelerius</i> applauds as an ingenious, learned, and probable Solution;
but, at the same time, rejects it as contradicting, in his Opinion, the
Apostolic Constitutions, and not supported by the Authority of any
antient Writer<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a>. The learned Dr. <i>Pearson</i> will admit no Opinion
that supposes Two Bishops to have presided together in one City<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a>,
that being an Irregularity, according to St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a>, <i>contrary to
the Ecclesiastic Disposition, contrary to the Evangelic Law, contrary
to the Rules of the Catholic Institution</i>, and condemned as such
by the Council of <i>Nice</i><a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a>. It is very much to be doubted, as I
have shewn above, whether St. <i>Peter</i> ever was at <i>Rome</i>, and consequently
whether <i>Clement</i> was ordained, by him, Bishop of that
City. His not succeeding him is a Proof, that he was not; for who
can imagine, that the People and Clergy of those Days would have
thought of chusing any other, or that any other, though chosen,
would have accepted of a Dignity, to which <i>Clement</i> had been named
by St. <i>Peter</i> himself, and which he was actually possessed of at the
Apostle’s Death? Be that as it will, <i>Linus</i> is now universally acknowleged
both by the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i> for the first Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the Life and Actions of <i>Linus</i>, all I can find in the Antients
concerning him, is, that it was he whom St. <i>Paul</i> mentioned
in his Epistle to <i>Timothy</i><a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a>; that, upon the Authority of the Apostolic
Constitutions, he was supposed, by some, to have been the Son
of <i>Claudia</i>, whom the Apostle mentions in the same Place<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a>; and
that his Life and Conversation were much approved of by the People<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Linus <i>no Martyr,<br/>tho’ placed among<br/>the Martyrs</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Church of <i>Rome</i> allows him, in the Canon of the Mass,
a Place among the Martyrs; but no mention is made of his having
suffered for the Faith, either in the antient Martyrologies, or in <i>Irenæus</i>,
who, speaking of him, and his immediate Successors, distinguishes
none but <i>Telesphorus</i> with the Title of Martyr. <i>Baronius</i>,
determined to maintain, right or wrong, the Credit of the sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Canon, in Opposition to all the Antients, nay, and to his own System,
cuts off one Year from the Pontificate of <i>Linus</i>, that he may
place his Death under <i>Vespasian</i>, and not, as <i>Eusebius</i> has done<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a>,
under <i>Titus</i>, in whose Reign he owns none to have suffered for the
Faith<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a>. Had he remembered what he must have read in <i>Tertullian</i>
and <i>Eusebius</i>, he had saved himself that Trouble: for <i>Tertullian</i>
assures us, that <i>Vespasian</i> made no Laws against the Christians<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a>; and
<i>Eusebius</i>, that he did not molest them, though he caused a diligent
Search to be made after those who were of the Race of <i>David</i>,
which occasioned a dreadful Persecution against the <i>Jews</i><a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a>. <i>Linus</i>
governed the Church of <i>Rome</i>, according to <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a> and <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a>,
Twelve Years; so that, if we place, with them, the Death of
St. <i>Peter</i> in 66. <i>Linus</i> must have died in the Year 78. of the Christian
Æra. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Books ascribed to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We have, under the Name of <i>Linus</i>, Two Books of the
Martyrdom of St. <i>Peter</i> and St. <i>Paul</i><a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a>; but they are generally
looked upon as supposititious<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a>. <i>Trithemius</i> makes him the Author
of the Life of St. <i>Peter</i>, in which a particular Account was given
of the Dispute between that Apostle, and <i>Simon</i> the Magician. This
Piece has not reached our Times, and was perhaps of the same
Stamp with the other, since it is never mentioned either by <i>Eusebius</i>,
or St. <i>Jerom</i>. The Decrees, that are ascribed to him, are no-where to
be found, but in <i>Anastasius Bibliothecarius</i>, and such-like Writers,
whose Authority is of no Weight in Matters so distant, unless supported
by the Testimony of the Antients.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Linus</i> was succeeded by <i>Cletus</i>, or <i>Anacletus</i>, whom the
<i>Greeks</i> constantly style <i>Anencletus</i>, that is, <i>Irreprehensible</i>. An
Opinion has long obtained in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, distinguishing
<i>Cletus</i> and <i>Anacletus</i> as Two Popes, nay, as Two Saints; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Festival of the one being kept on the 26th of <i>April</i>, and that of the
other on the 23d of <i>July</i><a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cletus <i>and</i> Ana-<br/>cletus <i>not two,<br/>but one Pope</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But this Distinction is now given up
by the most learned Men of that Church, not only as groundless, but
as plainly contradicting the most celebrated Writers of Antiquity,
<i>Irenæus</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>, and St. <i>Jerom</i>, to whom we may add <i>Caius</i>, a
Priest of <i>Rome</i>, who, writing in the Beginning of the Third Century,
reckoned <i>Victor</i> the Thirteenth Bishop of that City<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a>. <i>Baronius</i>,
however, spares no Pains to keep up that Distinction; but alleges
nothing to countenance it, except the Poem against <i>Marcion</i>,
ascribed to <i>Tertullian</i>, the Pontifical of <i>Anastasius</i>, and some Martyrologies<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a>.
Who was the Author of that Poem is not well known,
but all agree, that it was not written by <i>Tertullian</i><a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a>. Besides, the Author,
whoever he was, places both <i>Cletus</i> and <i>Anacletus</i> before <i>Clement</i>;
which <i>Baronius</i> condemns as a gross Mistake. As for the Pontifical,
the Annalist often finds fault with it; and complains, in this
very Place, that <i>Anastasius</i>’s whole Chronology is overcast with an
impenetrable Mist<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a>. The Martyrologies he quotes are of too modern
a Date to deserve any Regard, since none of them were heard
of before the Ninth Century<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How they were<br/>first disting-<br/>uished.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But how, says <i>Baronius</i>, was this
Distinction first introduced? We may, perhaps, account for it thus:
<i>Irenæus</i>, with all the <i>Greeks</i>, and St. <i>Jerom</i>, among the <i>Latins</i>,
place <i>Anacletus</i>, as we have observed above, before <i>Clement</i>; whereas
St. <i>Austin</i> and <i>Optatus Milevitanus</i> place him after. This, and his
being called <i>Cletus</i> by <i>Epiphanius</i>, and in several Copies of <i>Ruffinus</i>,
might induce some to imagine, that as the Names and Places were
different, so were the Persons. Thus, as we conjecture, of one Pope
Two Popes were made, Two Saints, and Two Martyrs; for, in the
Canon of the Mass, he has a Place with <i>Linus</i> among the Martyrs;
though neither was acknowleged for such by <i>Irenæus</i>, or any of
the Antients; nay, <i>Anacletus</i> is said, in some Pontificals, to have
<i>died in Peace</i>, that is, according to the Phrase of those Days, of a
natural Death<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a>. <i>Bollandus</i>, after having much laboured, but laboured
in vain, to maintain the Distinction between <i>Cletus</i> and <i>Anacletus</i>,
yields at last, and gives up the Point. But yet, unwilling to
make the least Alteration in the Catalogue of the Popes, which
places, with the Approbation of the Holy See, <i>Clement</i> between <i>Cletus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and <i>Anacletus</i>, he strives to save it with a new and pretty extraordinary
Invention; for he pretends <i>Anacletus</i> or <i>Cletus</i> to have resigned
the Chair to <i>Clement</i>, and <i>Clement</i>, in his Turn, to have
yielded it to him again. Thus, according to him, though <i>Cletus</i>
and <i>Anacletus</i> are one and the same Person, yet no Fault is to be
found with the Catalogue; and <i>Clement</i> is rightly placed both after
and before him<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a>. This is a Speculation of his own, altogether
groundless, and therefore not worthy of a Place here, were it not
to shew what low Shifts and Subterfuges even Men of Parts, in the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, chuse to submit to, rather than to yield to Reason,
in Points that seem to derogate from the Authority of that See.
<i>Anacletus</i> governed the Church Twelve Years, according to <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a>;
to which some add Two Months, some Three, and some only
one; so that he must have died in the Year 91. He is supposed to
have been buried next to St. <i>Peter</i>, in the <i>Vatican</i>, where his supposed
Body is shewn, and worshiped to this Day<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c015'><sup>[103]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Decretals ascribed<br/>to him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  We find, in
the Collection of <i>Isidorus Mercator</i>, Three Decretals, under the
Name of <i>Cletus</i>; but such Decretals as are anterior to the Pontificate
of Pope <i>Syricius</i>, who was elected in the Year 384 are now universally
looked upon as bare-faced Forgeries<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a><a id='rN3' /><a href='#fN3' class='c015'><sup>[N3]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fN3'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN3'>N3</a>. All the decretal Epistles of the
Popes, before <i>Syricius</i>, are so filled with
Absurdities, Contradictions, Anachronisms,
<i>&amp;c.</i> that they are now given up, even by
the most sanguine Advocates for the Papal
Supremacy. And yet these very Decretals,
absurd as they are, and inconsistent with
themselves, as well as with all the genuine
Writings of those Times, whether sacred
or profane, were, for several Ages, the
main Stays of the whole Fabric of the Papal
Power. By them that Power was established;
by them it was supported; for,
in the Days of Ignorance, they were universally
received as the genuine Writings
of the antient Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, in whose
Names they were published. And, truly,
were we to rank them, as they were ranked
in the monkish and ignorant Ages, with
the Decisions of the Oecumenical Councils,
and the Canonical Books of the Scripture,
no room would be left to question any
Branch of the unlimited Power claimed by
the Popes. They were held in the greatest
Esteem and Veneration from the Beginning
of the 9th Century to the Time of the
Reformation, when, upon the first Dawn
of Learning, the Cheat was discovered, and
the Stays removed, which till then had supported
the unwieldy Edifice. But it was
then in a Condition to stand by itself, at
least till new Frauds were devised to prop
it up; and this was accordingly done,
without Loss of Time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Decretals of the first Popes are
quoted by <i>Bellarmine</i>, to prove, that the
Supremacy of the Bishops of Rome was universally
acknowleged in the earliest Times<a id='rN3.1' /><a href='#fN3.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>:
but, at the same time, he owns, that <i>he
dares not affirm them to be of undoubted Authority</i>.
And what can be more absurd
than to quote a Forgery, or what he himself
owns may be a Forgery, in Vindication
of so darling a Point as <i>the Supremacy</i>?
But he did it for want of better Evidences,
and must therefore be excused. <i>Baronius</i>,
ashamed to lay any Stress on such gross and
palpable Forgeries, contents himself with
only saying, that the Popes had no hand
in forging them; and that they never made
use of their Authority to support their own.
That they were concerned in, or privy to,
the forging of those Letters, I dare not
affirm: but that they countenanced them,
as they did all other Forgeries tending to the
Advancement of their See; that they received
them as genuine, and endeavoured
to impose them upon others; nay, that
they made use of them soon after their first
Appearance in the World, to establish and
promote the Authority of their See; are
undoubted Matters of Fact: witness the
Letter, which <i>Nicolas</i> I. wrote, in the Year
865. to <i>Hincmarus</i> Archbishop of <i>Rheims</i>,
and to the other Bishops of <i>France</i>, who, refusing
to comply with some exorbitant Demands
of the Pope, had rejected the Decretals,
on which those Demands were
founded, as Writings that had been lately
counterfeited. <i>Nicolas</i>, in his Answer to
them, maintains the Authenticity of those
Letters, exhorts all, who profess the Catholic
Faith, to receive them <i>with due Veneration</i>,
and claims, in virtue of such sacred
and authentic Writings, an uncontrouled
Authority over all the Churches of
the World, as lodged from the Beginning
in his See<a id='rN3.2' /><a href='#fN3.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. And was not this
making use of the supposed Authority of
those Decretals to promote his own?
<i>Nicolas</i> seems to have believed the Letters
to be genuine: and, if he did, he
was certainly mistaken, and erred in proposing,
as he does, spurious Pieces for a
<i>firm and strong Foundation</i> of our Belief, as
well as our Practice. If he did not believe
them to be genuine, and yet endeavoured
to persuade the Bishops of <i>France</i> that they
were so; nay, and claimed, upon the Authority
of such Pieces, a Power over them,
and their Churches; a worse Epithet would
suit him better than that of <i>fallible</i>, which
is common to all Men.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first who published these Decretals
was, according to <i>Hincmarus</i>, <i>Riculphus</i>
Bishop of <i>Mentz</i>, who was supposed to have
brought them from <i>Spain</i>; because the
Name of <i>Isidore</i> was prefixed to the Collection,
and a famous Writer of that Name,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Isidore</i> Bishop of <i>Seville</i>, had flourished
in <i>Spain</i> some Centuries before. But
such a mean and scandalous Undertaking
is altogether unworthy of so great a Prelate;
and besides the Author of the supposed
Decretals has copied, <i>verbatim</i>, some
Passages from the Council of <i>Toledo</i> in 675.
and from the Sixth Council in 681. whereas
<i>Isidore</i> of <i>Seville</i> died in 636. The
learned <i>Ellies du Pin</i> lays this Forgery at
the Door of some <i>German</i> or <i>Frenchman</i>,
the Letters being all written in the Style of
the <i>Germans</i> and <i>French</i>, of the 9th Century,
and many of them addressed to Persons
of these two Nations. <i>Hincmarus</i>
was mistaken, in supposing the forged Decretals
to have been first published by <i>Riculphus</i>
of <i>Mentz</i>; for in some of them are
found Fragments of the Council held at
<i>Paris</i> in 829. and he died in 814. They
were first ushered into the World, and
forged too, in all likelihood, by one <i>Benedict</i>,
Deacon of the Church of <i>Mentz</i>,
though, in his Preface to that Collection,
he would fain make us believe, that <i>Autcarius</i>,
the Successor of <i>Riculphus</i>, found
them in the Archives of that Church, and
that they had been placed there by <i>Riculphus</i>,
who had brought them from <i>Spain</i>.
<i>Autcarius</i>, in whose Time <i>Benedict</i> published
his Collection, is thought to have
been privy to the Imposture. The Name
of <i>Isidore</i>, which was then very common
in <i>Spain</i>, was prefixed to it, to persuade
the World, that the Decretals were brought
from that Country, and not forged at
<i>Mentz</i>, where they first appeared. However,
they were suspected by some, even
in that dark Age, and absolutely rejected
by <i>Hincmarus</i> of <i>Rheims</i>, as Writings of
no Authority. But the Popes, whose Pretensions
they were calculated to favour, exerting
all their Authority to bring them
into Repute, they were in the End universally
received, and inserted into all the
Collections of Canons. At present they are
so universally exploded, that there is not a
single Writer, no, not even in the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, who is not ashamed to patronize or
defend them. But the Work is done, for
which they were intended; and now that
the Edifice can stand by itself, no matter
what becomes of the Stays that supported
it, when it could not. These Decretals
may be justly looked upon as a standing
Monument of the Ignorance, Superstition,
and Credulity, that universally prevailed in
the Church, from the Beginning of the
Ninth Century to the Time of the Reformation.
I shall conclude with observing,
that, from these Decretals, <i>Anastasius</i> the
<i>Bibliothecarian</i>, and after him <i>Platina</i>, have
chiefly copied what they relate of the first
Popes, supposing them to have really done
what, in those spurious Pieces, they are said
to have done.</p>

had before his Eyes the Rules and good Example they had given

he was well versed in every Branch of Learning, especially in polite
Literature, descended of a Senatorian Family, and nearly related to
the <i>Cæsars</i>, is what we read in <i>Eucherius</i><a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a> and <i>Nilus</i><a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a>, who seem

chosen by the People and Clergy of <i>Rome</i> to succeed him. He had
been named, say some, to that Dignity by St. <i>Peter</i> himself, preferably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to Linus and <i>Anacletus</i><a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a>; but had declined it, finding that

had before declined. Thus <i>Ruffinus</i>, upon the Authority of the
<i>Recognitions</i>; which appears to me, I must own, a very improbable
Tale. During his Pontificate happened an impious and detestable Division,
to use his own Terms, among the Christians of <i>Corinth</i>,

long after. It was by some ranked among the Canonical Books
of the Scripture, and by all reverenced next to them<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a>. It was written
in the Name of the whole Church of <i>Rome</i>, and to the whole
Church it is, in express Terms, ascribed by <i>Irenæus</i><a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c015'><sup>[120]</sup></a>, and <i>Clement</i>
of <i>Alexandria</i>, who calls it the Epistle of the <i>Romans</i> to the <i>Corinthians</i><a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a>.
However, it was composed by <i>Clement</i>, in the Name of
the Church; for, in the primitive Times, Bishops did nothing by
themselves, but every thing jointly with their Churches: <i>We advise</i>,
<i>We exhort</i>, <i>We recommend</i>, &amp;c. was their usual Style; which the Popes
still observe, though they mean only themselves; for they scorn to
join either with the People or Clergy. The Style of this excellent
Letter is plain, clear, full of Energy, without any useless Ornaments;
and the Whole written with the Simplicity, as <i>Photius</i> observes<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a>,
that the Church requires in Ecclesiastical Writers. There is so great
an Affinity, both as to the Sense and the Words, between this Epistle,
and the Epistle to the <i>Hebrews</i>, that some have concluded <i>Clement</i>
to have been the Translator, nay, and the Author of that Epistle<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Unjustly criticized<br/>by</i> Photius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In <i>Clement</i>’s Epistle <i>Photius</i> discovers, as he thinks, Three Faults;
<i>viz.</i> that he supposes other Worlds beyond the Ocean; that he
speaks of the Ph&oelig;nix as a real Bird; and that he uses Words
expressing the Humanity of our Saviour, and not his Divinity. But, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to the first of these Objections, there can be no Difficulty now,
that we know for certain what was but doubtfully advanced by the
Antients: in speaking of the Ph&oelig;nix he complies with the Opinion
universally received in those Days by the Learned, both among the
Christians and Pagans. As to the Third Objection, <i>Photius</i> must not
have observed, that he styles our Saviour’s Sufferings, the <i>Sufferings
of God</i>, which was acknowleging his Divinity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Thought lost, but<br/>appears again.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Epistle, the
most precious and valuable Treasure the Church can boast, after
the holy Scriptures, was for many Ages bewailed as lost; but, in 1633.
it was again restored to the Christian World, by <i>Patricius Junius</i>,
a <i>North Briton</i>, who published it from a Manuscript, written by an
<i>Egyptian</i> Lady, named <i>Thecla</i>, about the Time of the great Council
of <i>Nice</i>, and afterwards brought over into <i>England</i><a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a>. That this
Piece is genuine, appears from a great many Passages quoted out of
it by the Antients.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most remarkable Event that happened in the Pontificate of
<i>Clement</i>, was the Persecution of <i>Domitian</i>; but what Part he bore in
it we can learn from no credible Author. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Clement <i>dies.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He died, according to <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c015'><sup>[125]</sup></a>,
in the Third Year of <i>Trajan</i>’s Reign, that is, in the 100th
of the Christian Æra. In the Canon of the Mass he has a Place,
with his Two Predecessors, among the Martyrs; but <i>Telesphorus</i>, the
Seventh Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, is the first, as I have observed above, who was
acknowleged as such by <i>Irenæus</i>, whose Authority is of far greater
Weight than that of <i>Ruffinus</i>, or Pope <i>Zosimus</i>, who suppose him
to have died for the Confession of the Faith<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His fabulous Acts.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the Acts of <i>Clement</i>,
to which <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Tours</i> gave an intire Credit<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a>, and after
him many others, especially the Two credulous Annalists, <i>Baronius</i><a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a>,
and <i>Alford</i><a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c015'><sup>[129]</sup></a> in his Annals of the <i>British</i> Church, we read, that
<i>Clement</i> was banished, by <i>Trajan</i>, into the <i>Chersonesus</i>, beyond the
<i>Euxine</i> Sea; that there he caused a Fountain to spring up miraculously,
for the Relief of the Christians confined to the same unhospitable
Region; that he converted the whole Country to the Faith,
which provoked the Emperor to such a degree, that he ordered him
to be thrown into the Sea, with an Anchor fastened to his Neck.
It is added, that, on the Anniversary of his Death, the Sea retired to
the Place where he had been drowned, though Three long Miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>from the Shore; that upon its retiring, there appeared a most magnificent
Temple, all of the finest Marble; and in the Temple a stately
Monument, in which was found the Body of the Saint; that the
Sea continued thus retiring every Year on the same Day, not daring,
for the Space of Seven Days, to return to its usual Bounds, that the
Christians might, at their Leisure, and without Apprehension of Danger,
perform their Devotions in Honour of the Saint.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Miracles he<br/>wrought, unknown<br/>to</i> Irenæus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To crown the
Whole, they add, that, one Year, a Mother having heedlessly left her
young Child in the Temple, upon her Return, next Year, she found
it not only alive, but in perfect Health<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a>. No Mention is made of
such stupendous Miracles by <i>Irenæus</i>, who was brought up under
<i>Polycarp</i>, Bishop of <i>Smyrna</i>, in <i>Asia</i>, at the very Time <i>Clement</i> is
supposed to have suffered, and who speaks of him at Length. His
Silence is a plain Demonstration, that they were unknown to him;
and they must have been known, had they been true.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the Letter to the <i>Corinthians</i>, of which I have spoken above,
several other Pieces are ascribed to <i>Clement</i>; <i>viz</i>. a second Letter to
the <i>Corinthians</i>; which is, without all Doubt, very antient; but <i>Eusebius</i>
doubts whether it was written by <i>Clement</i><a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a>; and both St.

relating, under the Name of <i>Clement</i>, the Actions of St. <i>Peter</i>,

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Recognitions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  whence
the whole Work took the Name of <i>Recognitions</i>, that is, <i>of knowing

of St.</i> Peter, the <i>Acts of St.</i> Clement<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c015'><sup>[137]</sup></a>. The <i>Recognitions</i> are quoted
by <i>Origen</i><a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c015'><sup>[138]</sup></a>, <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a>, and <i>Ruffinus</i><a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a>, as the Work of <i>Clement</i>,
but these Writers, at the same time, own them to have been altered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in several Places, and falsified by the Heretics; nay, <i>Epiphanius</i> tells
us, that the <i>Ebionites</i> scarce left any thing found in them<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a>. The
Author was well versed in Philosophy, Mathematics, Astrology, and
most other Sciences, but not so well acquainted with the Doctrine
of the Church; whence his Work is absolutely rejected by <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a>;
and now generally looked upon as a Piece falsely ascribed to
<i>Clement</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St.</i> Peter<i>’s Dia-<br/>logues with</i> Apion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> St. <i>Peter</i>’s <i>Dialogues</i> with <i>Apion</i> were probably written
in the Third Century, and to gain Credit fathered upon <i>Clement</i>;
for <i>Eusebius</i> writes, that there had lately appeared a long Work, under
the Name of <i>Clement</i>, containing Dialogues between St. <i>Peter</i>
and <i>Apion</i><a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Apostolic<br/>Constitutions.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As to the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, if that Work is different
from <i>the Doctrine of the Apostles</i> mentioned by <i>Athanasius</i>
and <i>Eusebius</i>; <i>Epiphanius</i> is the first who speaks of it: it appears
at least, from <i>Dionysius</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, that, in the Year 250. the
Constitutions either had not yet appeared, or were of no Repute in
the Church<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a>. <i>Epiphanius</i> tells us, that many suspected them; but,
as for himself, he received them, since he found nothing in them
repugnant to the Faith, or the Discipline of the Church<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c015'><sup>[145]</sup></a>. But as
be quotes several Passages out of them, which are not to be found
now, we may well conclude, that, since his Time, they have been
either altered or curtailed. The <i>Greeks</i> indeed, in the Second Canon
of the Council, that, in 692. was held at <i>Constantinople</i>, in a
Tower of the Imperial Palace, called <i>Trullus</i>, that is, the <i>Cupola</i>,
declare, that they had been falsified, in several Places, by the Heretics.
<i>Photius</i> thinks that, with respect to the Style, they fall short of the
<i>Recognitions</i>, but far excel them in the Purity of the Doctrine, adding,
at the same time, that it is no easy Task to clear them from
the Imputation of <i>Arianism</i><a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a>. Dr. <i>Pearson</i> takes them to be a Collection
of several Pieces, published in the earliest Times, under the
Name of the Apostles, and containing, as was pretended, the Instructions
they had given<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c015'><sup>[147]</sup></a>. <i>Albaspinæus</i>, Bishop of <i>Orange</i>, thinks
the Matter they contain excellent, and the Whole agreeable to the
Discipline observed by the <i>Greek</i> Church, during the Four first Centuries;
bur nevertheless he looks upon them only as a Collection of
the different Customs, that were established, by degrees, in the Church,
and some of which were disputed even in the Fourth Century<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a>; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>that they can by no means be ascribed either to the Apostles, or to
<i>Clement</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Canons of<br/>the Apostles.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <i>Constitutions</i> end with 85 Canons, long known by
the Title of <i>The Canons of the Apostles</i>; but, as they contain several
things that were not received in the Apostles Time, nor in <i>Clement</i>’s,
the ablest Critics are of Opinion, that they likewise are but a Collection
of several Decrees made in the first Ages of the Church, and
that they were not collected into one Body till the Third Century<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a>.
I don’t find them quoted before the Council of <i>Constantinople</i> in
394. The <i>Greeks</i>, in the Council of the Year 692. mentioned above,
bound themselves to the Observance of them; but they are all rejected
by Pope <i>Gelasius</i>: however, <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i> having, not
long after, placed the first Fifty at the Head of his Collection, they
were received by degrees; but the other Thirty-five have not been
admitted to this Day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the Whole, of the many Writings ascribed to <i>Clement</i>, the
first Letter to the <i>Corinthians</i> is the only one undoubtedly his: and
what a wide Difference appears, as to the Spirit and Style, between that
excellent Piece, and the Briefs, Bulls, Mandates, <i>&amp;c.</i> of his Successors:
He does not command, but exhorts; he does not threaten, but
intreats; he does not thunder Anathema’s and Excommunications,
but employs the most mild and gentle Persuasives, even with the
Authors of the Schism. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Clement<i>’s Infal-<br/>libility unknown to<br/>him, and to the</i><br/>Corinthians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Had he known himself to be the infallible
and unerring Judge of Controversies, from whose Tribunal lay no
Appeal; had the <i>Corinthians</i> believed themselves bound, on Pain of
Damnation, to submit to his Decisions; there had been no Room for
Reasons, Arguments, and Persuasives; he ought to have exerted the
Power, with which he was vested, and put an End to all Disputes, in
the peremptory Style of his Successors, <i>We declare, and command all
Men to comply with this our Declaration, on pain of incurring the
Indignation of the Almighty; and</i>, as if that were not enough, <i>of
his blessed Apostles</i> Peter <i>and</i> Paul. But it was not till some Ages
after, that the Popes found out their Infallibility, or rather their flattering
Divines found it out for them; so that this invaluable Privilege
lying dormant, Men were obliged, for a long time, to make use of
their Reason, in deciding religious Controversies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Marcion <i>comes to</i><br/>Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Time of <i>Pius</i>, <i>Marcion</i>, a Native of <i>Pontus</i>, and the Son
of a Bishop of the holy Catholic Church, says <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c015'><sup>[191]</sup></a>, being
excommunicated by his Father for debauching a Virgin, and finding
he could by no means prevail upon the venerable Prelate to receive
him again into the Church, abandoned his native City, supposed to
be <i>Sinope</i>, and fled to <i>Rome</i>. Upon his Arrival there, he applied to
the Elders of that Church, intreating them to admit him to their Communion.
But those holy Men, who had been taught by the Disciples
of the Apostles, instead of complying with his Request, returned him
this Answer; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Power of<br/>receiving Appeals<br/> disowned by the<br/>Church of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> We cannot admit you without Leave from your holy
Father; nor can we, as we are all united in the same Faith, and the
same Sentiments, undo what our holy Collegue your Father has
done.--Thus <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c015'><sup>[192]</sup></a>. Had <i>Bellarmine</i> lived in those Days, he
had taught them another Doctrine, a Doctrine which, however necessary,
the Apostles had forgot to deliver to their Disciples; <i>viz.</i>
That the See of <i>Rome</i> was raised above all other Sees; that the Appeals
of the whole Catholic Church were to be brought to it; that
no Appeals were to be made from it; that it was to judge of the
whole Church, but be judged by none. <i>Marcion</i> did not apply to
<i>Pius</i>, as the Reader must have observed, or at least did not apply to
him alone, but to the Elders, who disclaimed all Power of reversing
the Sentence of a particular Bishop or Judge. And is not this an evident
and incontestable Proof that the Power of receiving Appeals was
not known, or thought of, in those Days? And yet, who would believe
it? <i>Bellarmine</i> has the Assurance to allege this very Case as an
Argument to prove in the Pope a Power of receiving Appeals<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c015'><sup>[193]</sup></a>.
But what would become of this Prerogative, should the Pope return
the same Answer to every Appellant?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pius <i>no Martyr</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Pius</i> governed the Church for the Space of Fifteen Years, and died
in 157. the Twentieth of <i>Antoninus</i><a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c015'><sup>[194]</sup></a>. The <i>Roman</i> Martyrology
tells us, that he was martyred in the Persecution of <i>Antoninus Pius</i>;
but in that Prince’s Reign there was no Persecution; nor is the Title
of Martyr given him by <i>Irenæus</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Writings ascribed<br/>to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Baronius</i> ascribes to this Pope a
Decree, commanding the Festival of <i>Easter</i> to be kept on <i>Sunday</i>,
and quotes the Chronicle of <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c015'><sup>[195]</sup></a>. This Decree is indeed mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in some Editions of that Writer; but <i>Scaliger</i> assures us, that no
Mention is made of it in any Manuscript Copy; and therefore he has
left it out in his Edition<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c015'><sup>[196]</sup></a>. As to the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>, it is
manifest from <i>Irenæus</i>, that though <i>Pius</i>, as well as his Predecessors
<i>Sixtus</i>, <i>Telesphorus</i> and <i>Hyginus</i>, differed from the Bishops of <i>Asia</i>,
yet they did not on that Account separate themselves from their Communion<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c015'><sup>[197]</sup></a>.
On this Pope are fathered several spurious Pieces, <i>viz.</i>
some Decrees, Two Letters ranked among the Decretals, and Two
more written to <i>Justus</i> Bishop of <i>Vienne</i> in <i>Dauphiné</i>. The Decrees,
as well as the Decretals, are universally rejected; and yet F. <i>Pagi</i>
quotes one of them to prove the real Presence in the Sacrament<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c015'><sup>[198]</sup></a>.
The two Letters to <i>Justus</i> are deemed genuine by <i>Baronius</i><a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c015'><sup>[199]</sup></a>, by Cardinal
<i>Bona</i><a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c015'><sup>[200]</sup></a>, and by <i>Blondel</i> in his Treatise of the Sibyls<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c015'><sup>[201]</sup></a>, who nevertheless
suspects them elsewhere<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c015'><sup>[202]</sup></a>. On the other hand, they are absolutely
rejected as false by Dr. <i>Pearson</i><a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c015'><sup>[203]</sup></a>, by <i>Cotelerius</i><a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c015'><sup>[204]</sup></a>, and <i>Natalis
Alexander</i><a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c015'><sup>[205]</sup></a>, who discover several Expressions in them that were not
in Use till some Ages after, and a great many Incoherences. To say
with <i>Le Sueur</i>, That they were written originally in <i>Greek</i>, and in
latter Times translated into <i>Latin</i><a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c015'><sup>[206]</sup></a>, is but a poor Evasion. As for
the Fable of <i>Hermes</i>, the Brother of <i>Pius</i>, who, by the Command of
an Angel appearing to him in the Disguise of a Shepherd, is said to
have written a Book shewing, that <i>Easter</i> ought to be kept on <i>Sunday</i>,
I refer the Reader to <i>Platina</i>, and such-like Writers.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Pius</i> was succeeded by <i>Anicetus</i>, in whose Time <i>Valentine</i> the
Heretic, who came to <i>Rome</i> in the Pontificate of <i>Hyginus</i>, and
had gained many Proselytes under <i>Pius</i>, continued sowing his pestilential
Errors among the Members of that Church: but many whom
he had seduced, were reclaimed by St. <i>Polycarp</i>, formerly the Disciple
of St. <i>John</i> the Evangelist, and then Bishop of <i>Smyrna</i>.
His declaring to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>them, that the Doctrine taught by the Church was the Doctrine he
had learnt of the Apostles, made such an Impression on their Minds,
that they abjured the Errors of <i>Valentine</i>, and returned to the Communion
of the Faithful<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c015'><sup>[207]</sup></a>. They preferred the bare Word of <i>Polycarp</i>,
who claimed no Infallibility, to the infallible Authority of <i>Hyginus</i>,
<i>Pius</i>, and <i>Anicetus</i>. This is a plain Proof, that the Popes had not
yet begun to exert their Infallibility; or, if they had, that it was not
acknowleged. What brought St. <i>Polycarp</i> to <i>Rome</i> was the Controversy
about the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>, which at this Time began to
grow very warm between the Eastern and Western Churches<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c015'><sup>[208]</sup></a>. All
the Churches of the East, and amongst the rest that of <i>Smyrna</i>, kept
<i>Easter</i> on the 14th Day of the Moon of the first Month, in Conformity
to the Custom of the <i>Jews</i>: on the other hand, <i>Anicetus</i> would
neither conform to that Custom himself, nor suffer any under his Jurisdiction
to conform to it, obliging them to celebrate that Solemnity
on the <i>Sunday</i> next following the 14th of the Moon. That this Dispute
might not occasion a Schism in the Church, <i>Polycarp</i> undertook
a Journey to <i>Rome</i>, in order to confer with the Bishop of that City,
who was the chief Opposer of the <i>Quartodecimans</i><a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c015'><sup>[209]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Anicetus <i>and he<br/>disagree about the<br/>Celebration of</i><br/>Easter, <i>but part<br/>without Breach of<br/>Charity</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But it happened
in this, as it does in most religious Disputes, they parted, each
retaining his own Way of thinking; but at the same time, what
happens but seldom, without the least Breach of that Charity which is
the great and fundamental Law of our holy Religion. In Token
whereof they communicated together at the holy Sacrament; nay,
<i>Anicetus</i>, out of Respect to St. <i>Polycarp</i>, yielded to him the <i>Eucharist</i><a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c015'><sup>[210]</sup></a>;
that is, gave him Leave to consecrate the <i>Eucharist</i> in his
own Church: after which they parted in Peace, though both determined
to follow the antient Practice of their respective Churches<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c015'><sup>[211]</sup></a>.
St. <i>Polycarp</i>, though well acquainted with the Doctrine of the Apostles,
was a Stranger, it seems, to that of <i>Bellarmine</i>, <i>Baronius</i>, &amp;c. <i>viz.</i>
that the whole Catholic Church is bound to conform to the Rites,
Ceremonies, and Customs of the Church of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hegesippus <i>and St.</i><br/>Justin <i>at</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Time of <i>Anicetus</i>, <i>Hegesippus</i>, and the celebrated Martyr
St. <i>Justin</i>, came to <i>Rome</i>, upon what Occasion is uncertain. The former
continuing there to the Pontificate of <i>Eleutherius</i>, wrote a Book
on the Doctrine which in that Church had been conveyed down from
the Apostles to <i>Anicetus</i>, and was still observed, says he, in all its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>original Purity<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c015'><sup>[212]</sup></a>. The latter opposed with great Zeal <i>Marcion</i>, and
his Followers, publishing a Book against his pernicious Tenets, and
against Heresies in general<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c015'><sup>[213]</sup></a>. It was at <i>Rome</i> that he had frequent
Conferences with <i>Crescens</i> the <i>Cynic</i>, a Man of some Note at that
Time; but, according to the Genius of his Sect, proud, surly, conceited,
and a declared Enemy to all who professed the Christian Religion,
which he painted in the blackest Colours<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c015'><sup>[214]</sup></a>. The Malice of
this <i>Cynic</i> procured in the End for our zealous and learned Apologist
what he had long and most ardently wished, the Glory of sealing with
his Blood the Truth, which he had so strenuously defended and promoted
with his Pen<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c015'><sup>[215]</sup></a>. He suffered under <i>Marcus Aurelius</i> and <i>L.
Verus</i> about the Year 167. towards the End of the Pontificate of
<i>Anicetus</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this Pope are ascribed by <i>Anastasius</i>, <i>Platina</i>, <i>Ciaconius</i>, and
other modern Writers, several Ordinances and Decrees; but as they

his Body was taken out of the same Place in 1604. and given by <i>Clement</i>

Captivity, he sent large Sums to ransom them, with a Letter to the

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Eleutherius</i> was Deacon of the Church of <i>Rome</i> in
168. when <i>Hegesippus</i> came to that City<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a>; but <i>Soter</i>, the Successor
of <i>Anicetus</i>, being dead, he was chosen to govern the Church

before the Death of the Martyrs of <i>Lions</i>, so famous in ecclesiastical
History; for the Controversy, which had been raised some Years before
in the Churches of <i>Asia</i>, by <i>Montanus</i> and his Followers, concerning
the prophetic Spirit, to which they pretended, making at
that time a great Noise in the Church, the Martyrs of <i>Lions</i>, desirous
to contribute, so far as in them lay, to the public Peace, wrote
Letters, from their Prisons, to the Churches of <i>Asia</i>, and likewise
to <i>Eleutherius</i>, Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, declaring their Judgment and Opinion
in the Case<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c015'><sup>[229]</sup></a>: for great Honour was paid, in those Times, to
the Martyrs, and their Opinion was always received with Esteem and
Veneration. It were much to be wished, that <i>Eusebius</i> had set down
their Opinion at Length; but he contents himself only with saying,
that it was intirely agreeable to true Piety, and to the orthodox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Faith<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c015'><sup>[230]</sup></a>; which, in my Opinion, is enough to make us reject the Notion
of Dr. <i>Pearson</i>, who takes it for granted, that they wrote in
Favour of those Fanatics, and that for no other Reason but because
they are said, by <i>Eusebius</i>, to have written for the Peace of the Church<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c015'><sup>[231]</sup></a>.
Was the admitting of false Prophets, and false Prophecies, giving
Peace to the Church? The same Writer adds, that <i>Eleutherius</i> was
induced, by the Reverence and Regard he had for the holy Martyrs,
to receive the Prophecies of <i>Montanus</i>, and his Two Prophetesses<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c015'><sup>[232]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Eleutherius <i>did not<br/>approve the Proph-<br/>ecies of</i> Montanus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But herein I must beg Leave to disagree with that learned Writer,
and likewise with Dr. <i>Cave</i><a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c015'><sup>[233]</sup></a>; for it was not, in my Opinion, <i>Eleutherius</i>,
but his Successor <i>Victor</i>, who received the Prophecies of <i>Montanus</i>.
<i>Tertullian</i>, the only Author who informs us, that the Dreams
of that Enthusiast were approved by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, does not
distinguish that Bishop by his Name; so that he is to be found out
only by Reasoning and Chronology. Now, on one hand, we read
in <i>Tertullian</i>, that <i>Montanus</i> had been opposed by <i>the Predecessors</i>
of the Bishop, who embraced his Opinions<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c015'><sup>[234]</sup></a>; and, on the other, in
<i>Eusebius</i><a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c015'><sup>[235]</sup></a>, that the Heresy of <i>Montanus</i> was first broached in the Year
171. the Eleventh of the Reign of <i>M. Aurelius</i>, and the Fourth of
the Pontificate of <i>Soter</i>, the immediate Predecessor of <i>Eleutherius</i>;
these Two therefore, and these alone, were the Bishops, who could
oppose <i>Montanus</i>; and, since the first Broaching of that Heresy, the
only Predecessors of the Bishop who embraced it. <i>Victor</i>, the Successor
of <i>Eleutherius</i>, was greatly provoked against the <i>Asiatic</i> Bishops,
on account of their refusing to comply with the Custom of the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, in the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>; and therefore might,
out of Spite to them, approve of the Opinions which they had condemned:
for <i>Montanus</i>, and his Followers, had been already condemned,
as <i>Eusebius</i> informs us<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c015'><sup>[236]</sup></a>, by several Synods held in <i>Asia
Minor</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Councils held without<br/>consulting the Bishop<br/>of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> No Opinion is now deemed heretical, unless condemned
by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who claims that Prerogative as peculiar to
himself; but the Synods of <i>Asia</i>, the first mentioned in History, after
that of the Apostles at <i>Jerusalem</i>, condemned the Opinions of <i>Montanus</i>,
and cut him off from their Communion, without consulting
or even acquainting therewith, the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. But, to return
to the Martyrs; some are of Opinion, that they condemned, in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Letters, the Tenets of <i>Montanus</i>, and his Followers; but, at the
same time, wrote in their Favour, to far as to intreat the Bishops of
<i>Asia</i>, and <i>Eleutherius</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, to treat them with Indulgence,
and admit them, upon Repentance, to their Communion<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c015'><sup>[237]</sup></a>.
This is but a bare Conjecture, not authorized by any of the Antients;
and we don’t find, that the <i>Montanists</i> ever shewed the least Inclination
to return to the Communion of the Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Florinus <i>and</i> Blastus<br/><i>broach their new<br/>Doctrine</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in the Pontificate of <i>Eleutherius</i>, that <i>Florinus</i> and <i>Blastus</i>
first broached their new Doctrine; which was readily embraced by
many at <i>Rome</i>; for they were both Presbyters of that Church<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c015'><sup>[238]</sup></a>.
<i>Florinus</i> was first one of the Emperor’s Officers in <i>Asia</i>, afterwards
the Disciple of St. <i>Polycarp</i>, then famous all over that Province; and,
lastly, Presbyter of the Church of <i>Rome</i>; but both he and <i>Blastus</i>
were degraded on account of their heretical Opinions, and cut off
from the Communion of the Faithful<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c015'><sup>[239]</sup></a>. Against <i>Florinus</i>, <i>Irenæus</i>,
then Bishop of <i>Lions</i>, wrote a Letter, intituled, <i>Of Monarchy, or
that God is not the Author of Evil</i><a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c015'><sup>[240]</sup></a>; and another Piece called, <i>De
Ogdoede</i>, that is, <i>of the Eight</i>; meaning, perhaps, the Eight <i>Eons</i>,
or Persons that composed the chimerical Divinity of the <i>Valentinians</i>;
for <i>Florinus</i> fell at last into that Heresy<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c015'><sup>[241]</sup></a>. Against <i>Blastus</i>, whom
<i>Pacian</i> surnames the <i>Greek</i><a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c015'><sup>[242]</sup></a>, <i>Irenæus</i> wrote a Book, intituled, <i>Of

ordaining <i>Easter</i> to be kept on the <i>Sunday</i> after the 14th of the first
Moon; but as no mention is made of such a Decree, by any Writer
of those Times, their Authority is of no Weight.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Conversion of</i><br/>Lucius, <i>a</i> British<br/><i>King</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Lucius</i>, a <i>British</i> King, is said, by <i>Bede</i>, to have written to Pope
<i>Eleutherius</i>, intreating him to send a proper Person into <i>Britain</i>,
to instruct him in the Mysteries of the Christian Religion; which the
Pope readily granted<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c015'><sup>[246]</sup></a>. But as this is vouched only by <i>Bede</i>, who
lived many Ages after him, and by a Pontifical, supposed to have been
written about the Middle of the Sixth Century, what Credit the
whole History of <i>Lucius</i> may deserve, I leave the Reader to judge.
Such a remarkable Event could not have escaped <i>Eusebius</i>, who,
speaking of this very Period of Time, tells us, that, at <i>Rome</i>, many
Persons, eminent for their Birth and Wealth, embraced the Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Religion, with their whole Families<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c015'><sup>[247]</sup></a>. A solemn Embassy from a
<i>British</i> King, and his Conversion, surely deserved a Place in the
History of the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The whole Account<br/>fabulous.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He informs us, that, in the Reign of <i>Commodus</i>,
and the Pontificate of <i>Eleutherius</i>, the Christian Religion
enjoyed a profound Tranquillity all over the World; that it flourished,
and attracted, to use his Expression, the Minds of many People<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c015'><sup>[248]</sup></a>. Had
he not here a favourable Opportunity of mentioning our Royal Proselyte,
who, in the Reign of <i>Commodus</i>, is supposed to have written
to <i>Eleutherius</i>, and by his means to have been converted to the
Christian Religion? To what can we ascribe the Silence of such an
exact and accurate Writer, concerning an Event which would have
greatly recommended both his History, and the Christian Religion?
To an invincible Antipathy, says the Jesuit <i>Alford</i><a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c015'><sup>[249]</sup></a>, which he bore
to the Name of <i>Britain</i>, and which was so prevalent in him, that he
chose rather to suppress the Conversion of <i>Lucius</i> than mention it.
But what could thus set <i>Eusebius</i> against <i>Britain</i>? Had he been ever
injured by the <i>Britons</i>? Does he not elsewhere mention both them
and their Country? This jesuitical, absurd, and groundless Speculation,
which must expose the Author of it to the Ridicule of every
Reader, I should perhaps have let pass unobserved, had he not in
this very Place insulted, beyond the Bounds of common Decency,
the Reformers of Religion, for rejecting some idle Ceremonies, which
he supposes to have been practised at the Conversion of <i>Lucius</i>. But,
not to lay the whole Stress on the Silence of <i>Eusebius</i>, and other
antient Writers, to whom King <i>Lucius</i> was utterly unknown, why
should he have been at the Trouble of sending to <i>Rome</i> for an Instructor?
Were there not many in his own Kingdom as capable of
instructing him as any <i>Rome</i> could send? The Christian Religion had
been planted in this Island long before the Reign of <i>Lucius</i>, in the
Time of the Apostles, as <i>Gildas</i> seems to insinuate<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c015'><sup>[250]</sup></a>, at least very
early in the Second Century; for <i>Origen</i>, who flourished in the Beginning
of the Third, tells us, that the Virtue of the Name of <i>Jesus</i>
had passed the Seas, to find out the <i>Britons</i> in another World<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c015'><sup>[251]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Several Monkish<br/>Fables concerning<br/>King</i> Lucius.</div>

<p class='c001'>The short Account, which <i>Bede</i> gives us of the Embassy and Conversion
of King <i>Lucius</i>, has not only been greedily swallowed by
the Monkish Writers, who came after him, but has served as a Ground-plot
to the innumerable Fables with which they have filled this Part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of their Histories. They even tell us the Names of the Embassadors
sent by <i>Lucius</i> to the Pope, and of the Legates <i>a Latere</i> sent by
the Pope to <i>Lucius</i>. The former were <i>Elvanus</i> and <i>Medwinus</i>, who,
being ordained Bishops by <i>Eleutherius</i>, returned to <i>Britain</i>, and
greatly contributed to the Conversion of this Island. These Fables
gained Credit, by Degrees, in those Ages of Ignorance and Superstition,
insomuch that the Two Embassadors were at last ranked among
the Saints; and their Bodies, where or when found, nobody knows,
exposed to public Veneration, in the Monastery of <i>Glassenbury</i>, on
the First of <i>January</i><a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c015'><sup>[252]</sup></a>. The Pope’s Legates were <i>Fugacius</i> and <i><a id='corr34.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Damia us'>Damianus</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_34.10'><ins class='correction' title='Damia us'>Damianus</ins></a></span></i>,
who, as we are told, went back to <i>Rome</i>, to obtain of <i>Eleutherius</i>
a Confirmation of what they had done; and, from <i>Rome</i>,
returned into <i>Britain</i>, with a Letter from the Pope to King <i>Lucius</i><a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c015'><sup>[253]</sup></a>.
As for the King himself, he is said to have quitted his Kingdom, and,
turning Missionary, to have preached the Gospel in <i>Germany</i>, especially
at <i>Ausburgh</i>; to have travelled from thence into the Country
of the <i>Grisons</i>; and, lastly, to have been ordained Bishop of <i>Coire</i>,
their Metropolis; and to have died there a Martyr<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c015'><sup>[254]</sup></a>. To these Monkish
Fables King <i>Lucius</i> owes a Place among the Saints; for on the Third
of <i>December</i> is kept, in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, <i>the Festival of</i> Lucius,
<i>King of the</i> Britons, <i>who died at</i> Coire <i>in</i> Germany<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c015'><sup>[255]</sup></a>: these are the
Words of the <i>Roman</i> Martyrology; but <i>Bede</i> does not so much as
mention him in his; a plain Proof, that what is said of his Preaching,
of his Martyrdom, <i>&amp;c.</i> was invented after that Writer’s Time.
And yet <i>Alford</i> has not only filled his Annals with these, and suchlike
fabulous Accounts, giving an intire Credit to them, but inveighs,
with great Acrimony, against those who have not the Gift of Belief
in the same Degree with himself, especially against <i>Dempster</i>, telling,
him, that till his Time the Conversion of <i>Lucius</i> had never been
questioned by any Man of Sense or Learning<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c015'><sup>[256]</sup></a>. And truly, the Story
of King <i>Lucius</i> has been credited even by the greater Part of Protestant
Writers, out of Respect to our venerable Historian; but as he
wrote many Ages after the pretended Conversion of that Prince, and
none of the Writers of those Days, whom such a remarkable Event
could hardly have escaped, give us the least Hint of it, we may be
well allowed to question the Whole, notwithstanding the Authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of <i>Bede</i>, which can be of no Weight with respect to Transactions
that are said to have happened in Times so remote.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Eleutherius</i> governed, according to the best Chronologers, Fifteen
Years; and died in 192. the last of the Emperor <i>Commodus</i><a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c015'><sup>[257]</sup></a>. To
him are ascribed a Decretal, addressed to the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, and a
Decree, declaring against <i>Montanus</i>, and his Followers, that no Food
was forbidden to the Christians; but both are deemed spurious. He
was buried, according to some, in the <i>Salarian Way</i>, according to
others, in the <i>Vatican</i>; but, in what Place soever he was buried, his
Body is now worshiped in the <i>Vatican</i> at <i>Rome</i>, in the Cathedral of
<i>Troia</i> in <i>Apulia</i>, and in several other Places<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c015'><sup>[258]</sup></a>. The Title of Martyr
is given him by the Church of <i>Rome</i>, but not by any of the antient
Writers. Under him flourished <i>Hegesippus</i>, who wrote, in Five
Books, an Account of what had happened in the Church since our
Saviour’s Death, to his Time<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c015'><sup>[259]</sup></a>. He came to <i>Rome</i> in the Pontificate
of <i>Anicetus</i>, who was chosen in 157. and, remaining there to the
Time of <i>Eleutherius</i>, who succeeded <i>Anicetus</i> and <i>Soter</i> in 177. he
wrote a Book on the Doctrine received by Tradition in that Church<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c015'><sup>[260]</sup></a>;

as it will, he can by no means be cleared from another Imputation,
namely, that of owning and approving the prophetic Spirit of <i>Montanus</i>,
and his Two Prophetesses, <i>Prisca</i> and <i>Maximilla</i>: for <i>Tertullian</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>his Contemporary, tells us, in express Terms, that he received
their Prophecies; that, upon receiving them, he gave Letters of Peace
to the Churches of <i>Asia</i> and <i>Phrygia</i>; but that one <i>Praxeas</i>, just
come from those Parts, giving him a false Account of those Prophets,
and their Churches, and remonstrating, that by approving them, he condemned
his Predecessors, prevailed upon him to revoke the Letters, which
he had already written in their Behalf. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> Infallibility,<br/><i>how defended by</i><br/>Baronius <i>and</i><br/>Bellarmine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Thus <i>Tertullian</i>, who was then
himself become a Follower of <i>Montanus</i><a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c015'><sup>[265]</sup></a>. Here <i>Baronius</i> and <i>Bellarmine</i>,
the Two great Advocates for the Pope’s Infallibility, are put
to a Stand: they own, and cannot help owning, that the Pope was
deceived, and imposed upon; but, for all that, will not give up his
Infallibility. How great is the Power of Prejudice and Prepossession!
They find the Pope actually erring, and yet maintain, that he cannot
err. But this Apostacy from common Sense, if I may be allowed the
Expression, is not, perhaps, so much owing to Prejudice, as to something
worse; for no Prejudice, however prevalent, can withstand the
indisputable Evidence of plain Matters of Fact. It is no new thing,
says <i>Baronius</i>, nor what ought to cause in us the least Surprize, that
a Pope should be over-reached by Impostors<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c015'><sup>[266]</sup></a>. A Pope over-reached
in Matters of Faith! What then becomes of Infallibility? or what is
the Use of it? But the <i>Montanists</i>, says <i>Bellarmine</i><a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c015'><sup>[267]</sup></a>, craftily concealed
from the Pope what was erroneous and heretical in their Prophecies;
so that he, discovering nothing in their Doctrine repugnant
to that of the Church, believed they had been unjustly accused to,
and condemned by, his Predecessors. But, in the first Place, <i>Tertullian</i>
tells us, in express Terms, that the Prophecies of <i>Montanus</i>, and
his Followers, were approved by the Pope; whereas the Prophecies,
which he is supposed by <i>Bellarmine</i> to have approved, were not the
Prophecies of <i>Montanus</i>, but others, quite different, and in every
respect orthodox. In the second Place, if <i>Victor</i> believed, that the
<i>Montanists</i> had been unjustly condemned by his Predecessors, he did
not believe them infallible; so that, in every Light, this Fact oversets
the pretended Infallibility. We may add, that, if the Pope’s Infallibility
depends upon a right Information, and neither he nor we can
know whether he has been rightly informed, his Infallibility is thereby

<div class='sidenote'><i>The famous Contro-<br/>versy about the Cele-<br/>bration of</i> Easter.</div>

<p class='c001'>But what most of all distinguished the Pontificate of <i>Victor</i> was,
the famous Controversy about the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>, between the
Eastern and Western Bishops; the former keeping that Solemnity on
the 14th Day of the first Moon, on what Day soever of the Week it
happened to fall; and the latter putting it off till the <i>Sunday</i> following.
This, surely, could not be a Point of any Consequence,
since the Apostles had not thought fit to settle any thing concerning
it; nay, by observing the Paschal Solemnity themselves, some on the
one Day, and some on the other, as it is manifest they did<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c015'><sup>[268]</sup></a>; they
plainly declared, that it was quite indifferent on what Day it was
observed. Accordingly, from the Apostles Time to <i>Victor</i>’s, each
Church had followed the Custom and Practice established by their
respective Founders, without giving the least Disturbance to others, or
being, on that Account, disturbed by them<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c015'><sup>[269]</sup></a>. Pope <i>Anicetus</i> even
suffered such of the <i>Asiatics</i> as happened to be at <i>Rome</i>, to celebrate
<i>Easter</i> after the manner of <i>Asia</i><a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c015'><sup>[270]</sup></a>: <i>Soter</i>, indeed; and his Successor
<i>Eleutherius</i>, obliged those who lived at <i>Rome</i> to conform to the
Custom of that Church; but that did not prevent their sending the <i>Eucharist</i>,
or Sacrament, to the Bishops who followed the opposite Practice<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c015'><sup>[271]</sup></a>;
for a Custom then obtained among Bishops to send the <i>Eucharist</i>
to each other, especially at <i>Easter</i>, in Token of Communion
and Peace; but this Custom was suppressed by the 14th Canon of the
Council held in the Fourth Century at <i>Laodicea</i><a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c015'><sup>[272]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Victor<i>’s haughty<br/>Conduct</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Victor</i>, not satisfied
with what his Two immediate Predecessors had done, took upon
him to impose the <i>Roman</i> Custom on all the Churches that followed
the contrary Practice. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Is opposed by the<br/>Bishop of</i> Ephesus,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But, in this bold Attempt, which we may call
the first Essay of Papal Usurpation, he met with a vigorous and truly
Christian Opposition from <i>Polycrates</i>, at that Time Bishop of <i>Ephesus</i>,
and one of the most eminent Men in the Church, both for Piety
and Learning. He had studied, says <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c015'><sup>[273]</sup></a>, the Scriptures with
great Attention, had conferred with Christians from all Parts of the
World, and had ever conformed his Life to the Rules of the Gospel.
<i>Jerom</i> speaks of him as a Man of excellent Parts, and one universally
respected<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c015'><sup>[274]</sup></a>. In the present Controversy, he peremptorily refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to relinquish the Practice of his own Church, which had been first
introduced by the Apostles St. <i>John</i> and St. <i>Philip</i>, and had been
handed down to him by Seven Bishops of his own Family<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c015'><sup>[275]</sup></a>. Hereupon
<i>Victor</i>, impatient of Contradiction, wrote a Letter, threatening to
cut him off from his Communion, unless he forthwith complied
with the Practice of the Church of <i>Rome</i><a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c015'><sup>[276]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and by a Council of<br/>all the Bishops of</i> Asia minor.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Polycrates</i>, greatly
surprised at the hasty Proceedings of his Fellow Bishop, assembled in
<i>Ephesus</i> a Council of all the Bishops of <i>Asia minor</i>, when it was
unanimously resolved, that the Practice, which they had received from
their Predecessors, ought not to be changed<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c015'><sup>[277]</sup></a>. <a id='corr38.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Agreeab y'>Agreeably</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.11'><ins class='correction' title='Agreeab y'>Agreeably</ins></a></span> to this
Resolution, <i>Polycrates</i> writ to <i>Victor</i>, acquainting him therewith;
and, at the same time, modestly insinuating, that, as to his Menaces,
he had better forbear them, since they had no manner of Effect upon
him, or his Brethren<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c015'><sup>[278]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He cuts them off<br/>from his Communion.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Upon the Receipt of this Letter <i>Victor</i>,
giving the Reins to an impotent and ungovernable Passion, published
bitter invectives against all the Churches of <i>Asia</i>, declared them cut
off from his Communion, sent Letters of Excommunication to their
respective Bishops; and, at the same time, in order to have them cut
off from the Communion of the whole Church, writ to the other
Bishops, exhorting them to follow his Example, and forbear communicating
with their refractory Brethren of <i>Asia</i><a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c015'><sup>[279]</sup></a>. They all complied,
to be sure, with the Desire of the Head of the Church, who had
Power to command; but, out of his great Moderation, chose to exhort
and advise! <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>No Regard had to<br/>his Excommunication.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  No; not one followed his Example, or Advice; not
one paid any sort of Regard to his Letters, or shewed the least Inclination
to second him in such a rash and uncharitable Attempt; but,
on the contrary, they all joined, as <i>Eusebius</i> assures us<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c015'><sup>[280]</sup></a>, in sharply
censuring and rebuking him, as a Disturber of the Peace of the
Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is censured by</i> Irenæus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Among the rest <i>Irenæus</i>, then Bishop of <i>Lions</i>, writ him
an excellent Letter, putting him in mind of the Moderation of his
Predecessors, and telling him, that though he agreed with him in the
Main of the Controversy, yet he could not approve of his cutting off
whole Churches, for the Observance of Customs, which they had
received from their Ancestors. He writ, at the same time, to many
other Bishops<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c015'><sup>[281]</sup></a>, no doubt, to dissuade them from joining the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>. However that be, it is certain, that, by this means, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Storm was laid, a Calm was restored to the Church, and the <i>Asiatics</i>
allowed to follow undisturbed their antient Practice<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c015'><sup>[282]</sup></a>. But Pope
<i>Victor</i>, says <i>Baronius</i><a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c015'><sup>[283]</sup></a>, excommunicated the <i>Asiatics</i>, which he would
never have ventured to do, had he not known, that he had Power
and Jurisdiction over them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Had no Power over<br/>the</i> Asiatics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Argument may be thus retorted
against him: The <i>Asiatics</i> made no Account of his Excommunication;
which they would not have ventured to do, had they not known, that
he had no Power nor Jurisdiction over them. Besides, <i>Victor</i> did not
excommunicate them, as that Word is now understood; that is, he
did not cut them off from the Communion of the Catholic Church;
for all the other Bishops continued to communicate with them, as they
had done before; he only separated himself from their Communion;
which was no more than every Bishop had Power to do. <i>Victor</i> being
thus baffled in his Attempt, his Successors took care not to revive
the Controversy; so that the <i>Asiatics</i> peaceably followed their antient
Practice till the Council of <i>Nice</i>, which, out of Complaisance to
<i>Constantine the Great</i>, ordered the Solemnity of <i>Easter</i> to be kept
every-where on the same Day, after the Custom of <i>Rome</i><a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Dispute happened, not in the Reign of <i>Commodus</i>, as we read
in the <i>Synodicon</i><a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c015'><sup>[285]</sup></a>, but in the Fourth Year of the Reign of <i>Severus</i>,
as St. <i>Jerom</i> informs us<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c015'><sup>[286]</sup></a>, of Christ 196. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Victor <i>dies</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Victor</i>, of whom we find
nothing else in the Antients worthy of Notice, died Five Years after<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a>,
that is, in the Ninth of the Emperor <i>Severus</i>, and in the End of
201. or the Beginning of 202. of Christ, having governed the Church
Ten Years. He is named, by St. <i>Jerom</i>, the first among the Ecclesiastical
Authors that wrote in <i>Latin</i><a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c015'><sup>[288]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Works.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He published a Piece, on the
Controversy about the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>, and some other Books
on religious Subjects, which were still extant in St. <i>Jerom</i>’s Time<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c015'><sup>[289]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pieces falsly<br/>ascribed to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As for the Two Decretals that are ascribed to him, and the Two Letters
to <i>Desiderius</i> and <i>Paracoda</i>, both Bishops of <i>Vienne</i>, they are

the Power and extend the Jurisdiction of that See, deserved no less
a Reward.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'>In the first Year of the Pontificate of <i>Zephyrinus</i>, who succeeded
<i>Victor</i>, a dreadful Persecution was raised against the Christians
by the Emperor <i>Severus</i>, and carried on with great Cruelty in all
Parts of the Empire. <i>Zephyrinus</i>, however, had the good Luck to
escape it, and to see the Church, by the Death of that Prince, happily
delivered from the Evils, which the Rage of her foreign Enemies
had brought upon her. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Zephyrinus <i>opposes<br/>the</i> Theodotian<br/><i>Heretics</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But her domestic Enemies gave her no Respite;
the <i>Theodotian</i> Heretics continued sowing, and not without
Success, their pestilential Errors at <i>Rome</i>. <i>Zephyrinus</i>, it seems, opposed
them with great Vigour and Zeal; for they reproached him, as
we read in <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c015'><sup>[291]</sup></a>, as the first who had betrayed the Truth, by maintaining
against them the Divinity of <i>Christ</i>: hence he is ranked, by
<i>Optatus</i>, with <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Victorinus</i>, &amp;c. among those who have
successfully defended the Catholic Church<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c015'><sup>[292]</sup></a>. <i>Baronius</i>, to extol <i>Zephyrinus</i>,
ascribes to him the first Condemnation of <i>Praxeas</i><a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c015'><sup>[293]</sup></a>, which
was followed by a solemn Retractation under his own Hand. But it
was in <i>Africa</i>, and not at <i>Rome</i>, that <i>Praxeas</i> was condemned, as
appeared plain to me, from the Words of <i>Tertullian</i><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c015'><sup>[294]</sup></a>, before I had
seen either <i>Pamelius</i> or <i>Moreau</i>, who understood them in that Sense.
<i>Praxeas</i>, as we have observed above, had done an eminent Piece of
Service to the Church of <i>Rome</i>, by reclaiming Pope <i>Victor</i> from the
Heresy of <i>Montanus</i>: but the Good he had done on that Occasion was
over-balanced by the Mischief his new Heresy occasioned both at
<i>Rome</i> and in <i>Africa</i>; for in both Places he gained many Proselytes.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Heresy of</i><br/>Praxeas.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He denied all Distinction of Persons in the Godhead, so that the Father
being, according to his Doctrine, the same Person with the Son,
it was he who took upon him human Nature, and suffered on the
Cross; whence his Followers were called <i>Patropassians</i><a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c015'><sup>[295]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Pontificate of <i>Zephyrinus</i>, and, as <i>Eusebius</i> seems to insinuate,
in the Beginning of the Reign of <i>Caracalla</i>, that is, towards
the Year 211 or 212. came to <i>Rome</i> the celebrated <i>Origen</i>, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>desirous, as he himself declared, to see that Church, so venerable for
its Antiquity and Renown; but, after a very short Stay there, he returned
to <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c015'><sup>[296]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Famous Dispute, at</i><br/>Rome, <i>between</i> Caius<br/><i>and</i> Proclus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  About the same time happened, at <i>Rome</i>, the famous Dispute between <i>Caius</i>, a Presbyter of that Church and
<i>Proclus</i>, a leading Man among the <i>Montanists</i><a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c015'><sup>[297]</sup></a>. <i>Caius</i> committed
to Writing the Reasons and Arguments on both Sides<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c015'><sup>[298]</sup></a>: but that
Piece has not reached our Times, though it was well known to <i>Eusebius</i>,

<div class='sidenote'>Tertullian <i>falls<br/>off from the Church</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was during the Pontificate of <i>Zephyrinus</i> that <i>Tertullian</i>, the
great Defender of the Christian Religion, fell off from the Catholic
Church. His Fall, which was lamented by all the Faithful as a
common Loss, is ascribed, by St. <i>Jerom</i>, to the Envy and ill
Usage he met with from the <i>Roman</i> Clergy<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c015'><sup>[301]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Titles of</i> High<br/> Pontiff, <i>&amp;c. whether,<br/> and in what Sense,<br/> given by</i> Tertullian<br/> <i>to the Bishop of</i><br/> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But how ill soever
he was used by them in those Days, he has perhaps met with
worse Treatment at their Hands in latter Times; for they call upon
him as an Evidence, to witness the Pope’s universal Jurisdiction, and
to confirm to him the haughty Titles, which he assumes; but with
how little Reason, will appear from the following Relation: A Catholic
Bishop had, by a public Declaration, admitted Persons guilty of
Adultery and Fornication to a Place among the Penitents. As <i>Tertullian</i>
was a strict Observer of Rites and Discipline, and a most
zealous Asserter of the greatest Rigours of Religion, he could not
brook so much Moderation and Indulgence: and therefore, in his
Book <i>De Pudicitia</i>, which he wrote on that Occasion, he extols the
Severity of the antient Discipline, aggravates the Greatness of those
Offences, undertakes to confute the Arguments for Remission and
Indulgence; and, speaking of the above-mentioned Declaration, he
calls it <i>a peremptory Decree</i>, and styles the Bishop, who made it, <i>high
Pontiff</i>, and <i>Bishop of Bishops</i><a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c015'><sup>[302]</sup></a>. Hence the Advocates for the See
of <i>Rome</i> infer, that, even in those early Times, such Titles were
given to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and that his Decrees were even then
deemed peremptory<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c015'><sup>[303]</sup></a>. But in the first Place, it is uncertain whether
that Declaration was published by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, or by some
other great Bishop, perhaps of <i>Carthage</i>, of <i>Alexandria</i>, or <i>Antioch</i>;
for no Bishop is named by <i>Tertullian</i>. In the second Place, it is evident
from the Context, that, in the above-mentioned Passage, <i>Tertullian</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>speaks ironically; and consequently all that can be inferred from
thence is, that he gave those Titles to the Catholic Bishop, whoever
he was, by way of Derision; or if the Bishop had assumed them in his
Declaration, he took from thence Occasion to expose his Vanity and
Ambition. <i>Baronius</i>, and the Flatterers of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, triumph
in this Passage of <i>Tertullian</i>; from which however nothing can
be inferred in Favour of that See, unless they prove, which they can
never do, that the above-mentioned Declaration or Decree was published
by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>; that those Titles, which raise him above
other Bishops, were Part of the Decree; and lastly, that <i>Tertullian</i>
mentioned them as due to him, and not by way of Sarcasm, ironically
reflecting on his Pride and Ambition.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the Actions of <i>Zephyrinus</i>, the Antients have left us quite in
the Dark; and we cannot depend on what we read in the modern
Writers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Zephyrinus <i>not a Martyr</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He governed about Seventeen Years, and died in the first

Martyrology he has a Place among the Martyrs, which puts <i>Baronius</i>
himself to a Stand<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c015'><sup>[305]</sup></a>, since the Church enjoyed a profound
Tranquillity from the Death of <i>Severus</i> to the End of his Pontificate.</p>

mistake not the Meaning of a profane Writer, the free Exercise of
their Religion<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c015'><sup>[309]</sup></a>: it is at least certain, that he adjudged to them, against
the Tavern-keepers, a Piece of Ground, which it is pretended they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>had usurped upon the Public, laying, when he gave Sentence in their
Favour, that it was better God should be served on it in any Manner,
than that it should be occupied by Tavern-keepers<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c015'><sup>[310]</sup></a>; which was giving
them Leave to serve God on it after their own Manner. On this
Spot of Ground <i>Baronius</i> supposes <i>Callistus</i> to have built a Church
in Honour of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, known at present by the Name of
<i>Santa Maria in Trastevere</i>, that is, <i>Saint Mary beyond the Tyber</i><a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c015'><sup>[311]</sup></a>.
But the Pontifical of <i>Damasus</i>, upon which alone he sounds his Opinion,
deserves no Credit, as I shall shew in the Life of that Pope.
<i>Callistus</i> is said by <i>Anastasius</i><a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c015'><sup>[312]</sup></a> to have inclosed a large Piece of
Ground on the <i>Appian</i> Way, to serve as a Burying-place for the

Martyrs, and 46 Popes, were buried in it<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a>. Though <i>Alexander</i> was
of all the Pagan Emperors the most favourable and indulgent to the
Christians, as is evident from all the antient Writers, both Christians
and Pagans, yet he is represented in the Martyrologies, and in the
Acts of some Martyrs, especially of <i>Callistus</i>, to which <i>Bede</i> gave an

St. <i>Cæcilia</i>, in whose Honour Churches have been erected in
every Christian Kingdom. <i>Baronius</i>, not presuming on one Side to
question the Emperor <i>Alexander</i>’s Kindness to the Christians, which
would be giving the Lye to all the Antients, but, on the other, looking
upon it as a Sacrilege to rob the Church of so many valuable
Reliques, ascribes the cruel Usage they are supposed to have met
with in that Prince’s Reign, not to him, but to <i>Ulpian</i> the celebrated
Civilian, who flourished under him<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c015'><sup>[315]</sup></a>. But in those Acts the Martyrs
are said to have suffered unheard of Torments, there minutely described,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>by the express Command of the Emperor <i>Alexander</i>. Besides,
could <i>Alexander</i> be said to have favoured the Christians, could the
Christians be said to have enjoyed a happy Tranquillity under him,
had one of his Officers persecuted them with the utmost Cruelty in
his Name, and by his Authority? <i>Baronius</i>, not remembring, it
seems, that in this Place he had charged <i>Ulpian</i> with all the Cruelties
against the Christians, supposes elsewhere<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c015'><sup>[316]</sup></a> several Martyrs to have
suffered in the Reign of <i>Alexander</i>, after the Death of <i>Ulpian</i>. <i>Bede</i>,
'tis true, has followed these Acts; but they are not on that Account
at all the more credible, since he often follows Pieces which are now
universally given up as supposititious. The very first Words of these
Acts are sufficient to make us suspect the Truth of them; for they
begin thus; <i>in the Time of</i> Macrinus <i>and</i> Alexander--How come
these two Princes to be joined together? <i>Macrinus</i> reigned with his
Son <i>Diadumenus</i>, and <i>Heliogabalus</i> between them and <i>Alexander</i>.
Soon after the Consul <i>Palmatius</i> is said to have been condemned
without any Form of Judgment, without so much as being heard;
whereas <i>Herodian</i> assures us, that <i>Alexander</i> was a strict Observer of
the Laws; and that no Criminal was condemned in his Reign, but
according to the usual Course of Law, and by Judges of the greatest
Integrity<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c015'><sup>[317]</sup></a>. <i>Callistus</i>, if we give Credit to his Acts, was kept a long
time Prisoner in a private House, where he was every Day cruelly
beaten by the Emperor <i>Alexander</i>’s Orders, and at last thrown headlong
out of the Window into a Well. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Callistus <i>not a Martyr</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Acts are evidently fabulous,
but <i>Callistus</i> nevertheless is worshiped among the Martyrs; and
the Waters of the Well, which is to be seen at <i>Rome</i> in the Church
that bears his Name, are said to cure all sorts of Diseases to this Day.
He governed the Church Five Years, and died in the Latter-end of the
Year 223<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c015'><sup>[318]</sup></a>. the Third of the Emperor <i>Alexander</i>. His Body is exposed
to public Adoration on the Tenth of <i>May</i>, in the Church of
St. <i>Mary</i>, beyond the <i>Tyber</i>, at <i>Rome</i><a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c015'><sup>[319]</sup></a> and in that of our Lady at
<i>Rheims</i><a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c015'><sup>[320]</sup></a>. Two Decretals are ascribed to <i>Callistus</i>, and likewise the
Institution of the Ember-Weeks, but without the lean Foundation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fN4'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN4'>N4</a>. This Pontifical, well known to <i>Cuspinian</i>,
<i>F. Petau</i>, and other Chronologers,
was published by <i>Bucherius</i> the <i>Jesuit</i>, in
1633. with the <i>Paschal Cycle of Victorius</i>.
It is a Catalogue of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>,
from the Foundation of that See to the
Time of <i>Liberius</i>, who was chosen in 352.
As the Election of <i>Liberius</i> is marked, and
not his Death, the Catalogue is supposed
by some to have been written in his Time.
His Election is marked thus; <i>Liberius fuit
temporibus Constancii ex die</i> xi. <i>Kalendas
Junias in diem--a Consulibus Constantio</i> V.
<i>&amp; Constantio Cæsare</i>--By <i>Constantius Cæsar</i>
is meant <i>Gallus</i>, the Son of <i>Julius
Constantius</i>, who, by his Father <i>Constantius
Chlorus</i>, was Half-brother to <i>Constantine
the Great</i>. <i>Gallus</i> was raised by the
Emperor <i>Constantius</i> to the Dignity of <i>Cæsar</i>
in the Year 351. on which Occasion
he gave him his own Name<a id='rN4.1' /><a href='#fN4.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, and the
following Year took him for his Collegue
in his Fifth Consulship, as appears from
<i>Idatius</i>, from <i>Prosper</i>, and from the <i>Alexandrian</i>
Chronicle. The above-mentioned
Pontifical is very faulty in the Times preceding
the Pontificate of <i>Pontianus</i>, who
was chosen in 230. nay, if we believe <i>Bucherius</i>,
<i>Anicetus</i>, <i>Eleutherius</i>, and <i>Zephyrinus</i>,
are omitted in it. I said, <i>If we believe</i>
Bucherius; for <i>Bollandus</i>, another
<i>Jesuit</i>, who perused the same Manuscript,
assures us, that he found there the Names
of those three Bishops, which <i>Bucherius</i>
assures us were not to be found there<a id='rN4.2' /><a href='#fN4.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
Which of the two <i>Jesuits</i> is the honester is
hard to determine in any Case, but impossible
in this, unless the original Manuscript should
be produced, which both perused. F. <i>Pagi</i>,
the <i>Franciscan</i>, seems to favour <i>Bucherius</i>;
for he complains of <i>Bollandus</i> for interpolating
the Manuscript, and not publishing
it with all its Faults and Charms, as <i>Bucherius</i>
had done. But then he does not tell
us, that he had seen the original Manuscript.
<i>Bollandus</i> on the other hand complains of
<i>Bucherius</i> for undervaluing such an unvaluable
Piece; and settles by it his whole
Chronology of the Popes, pretending it to
have been sent by Pope <i>Damasus</i> to St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='rN4.3' /><a href='#fN4.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.
But for this the only Ground he
has are some Letters from <i>Damasus</i> to St.
<i>Jerom</i>, and from <i>Jerom</i> to <i>Damasus</i>, which,
by the best Judges, are all thought supposititious.
But even allowing it to have
been sent by <i>Damasus</i> to St. <i>Jerom</i>, that
ought not to recommend it more to our
Esteem than it did to his; and he seems to
have paid very little Regard to it: for in
his Book of <i>Illustrious Men</i>, which he wrote
after the Death of <i>Damasus</i>, he places
<i>Clement</i> after <i>Anacletus</i>, though that Pontifical
puts <i>Anacletus</i> after <i>Clement</i><a id='rN4.4' /><a href='#fN4.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
What I have hitherto said is to be understood
with respect to the Times preceding
the Pontificate of <i>Pontianus</i>; for, from his
Time, the Pontifical of <i>Bucherius</i> is almost
quite exact to the End, that is, to the Election
of <i>Liberius</i>; and the more exact, the
nearer it comes to his Time. I said <i>almost</i>,
for it is not even thenceforth free from all
Faults; but it has fewer than any other
antient Record that has reached us; and it
is on this Consideration that, from the Time
of <i>Pontianus</i>, I have preferred it to all
others. With respect to his Predecessors,
I have adopted the Chronology of <i>Eusebius</i>,
where it does not appear that he was mistaken;
for that he was mistaken in some
Points, is but too plain; and, for aught we
know, he may have been so in many others.
But as in those dark Times we have no
authentic Records, no indisputable Authorities,
to depend on, I thought it more
adviseable to tread in the Footsteps of so
famous and antient a Writer, than, by
attempting to open a new Way, perplex
and confound both myself and the Reader,
as <i>Pearson</i>, <i>Dodwell</i>, and <i>Pagi</i>, have
done. And it was not, I must own, without
some Concern, that I found a Man of
Dr. <i>Pearson</i>’s Learning reduced, by undervaluing
the Authority of <i>Eusebius</i>, to take
for his Guide a Writer of no Authority at
all, <i>viz.</i> <i>Eutychius</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, who flourished
so late as the Tenth Century, and is
only famous for his Blunders, even in what
relates to his own Church.
To the Pontifical were annexed, in the
same antient Manuscript, several other small
Pieces; <i>viz.</i> 1. A List of the Consuls from
the Year 205. to 354. with the Epacts,
Bissextile Years, and the Day of the Week,
with which each Year began. There are
some Mistakes in the Epacts, but the rest
is done with great Exactness. 2. Another
List of the Consuls and Governors of <i>Rome</i>,
from the Year 254. to 354. 3. A short
Necrology of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, in which
are marked, according to the Order of the
Months, the Day on which each of them
died, and the Place where he was buried.
It begins with <i>Lucius</i>, and ends with <i>Julius</i>.
In this List, <i>Sixtus</i> II. and <i>Marcellus</i>
are omitted; the latter probably by a
Mistake of the Transcriber, confounding
him with his Predecessor <i>Marcellinus</i>; and
the former, perhaps, because he is set down
in the Calendar of Martyrs annexed to the
Necrology. These Pieces, as well as the
Pontifical, all end at the Year 354. whence
Cardinal <i>Noris</i><a id='rN4.5' /><a href='#fN4.5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and others are of Opinion,
that they were written that Year.</p>

and not an Inhabitant of <i>Rome</i>, but just then come out of the Country.
At this Prodigy the whole Assembly cried out with one Voice,

<div class='sidenote'>Fabianus <i>worthy of<br/>the Dignity to<br/>which he was raised</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for <i>Fabianus</i>, he seems to have been well worthy of the Post
to which he was raised; for the famous Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, St.
<i>Cyprian</i>, in Answer to the Letter, wherein the Clergy of <i>Rome</i> gave
him an Account of the glorious Death of their Bishop, calls him <i>an
excellent Man</i>; and adds, that <i>the Glory of his Death had answered
the Purity, Holiness, and Integrity of his Life</i><a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c015'><sup>[339]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some of his<br/>Regulations.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  From the Pontifical
of <i>Bucherius</i> we learn, that he appointed Seven Deacons over
the Fourteen Regions, or Wards, into which <i>Rome</i> was then divided<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c015'><sup>[340]</sup></a>,
to take care of the Poor, says <i>Baronius</i><a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c015'><sup>[341]</sup></a>. We read in other more
modern Pontificals, that he named Seven Subdeacons to overlook the
Seven Notaries, who are supposed to have been first appointed by Pope
<i>Clement</i>, and whose Province it was to commit to Writing the Actions
and Speeches of the Martyrs. It is manifest from St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c015'><sup>[342]</sup></a>, as Dr.
<i>Pearson</i> well observes, that in the Time of <i>Cornelius</i>, the Successor
of <i>Fabianus</i>, the Church of <i>Rome</i> had Seven Subdeacons, to whom
St. <i>Cyprian</i> recommended the strictest Exactness in marking the Day of
each Martyr’s Death<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c015'><sup>[343]</sup></a>. As for taking down their Speeches, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>some seem to object to, the Art of writing in Short-hand was well
known in those Times. <i>Eusebius</i> tells us, that by <i>Tiro</i>, <i>Cicero</i>’s
Freed-man, were first invented certain Marks, which stood not only
for whole Words, but intire Sentences<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c015'><sup>[344]</sup></a>. But this Invention is, by
<i>Dio</i>, ascribed to <i>Mæcenas</i>, who ordered his Freed-man <i>Aquila</i> to
make them known to all who cared to learn them<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c015'><sup>[345]</sup></a>. Of their wonderful
Quickness in writing, with the Help of these Marks, <i>Martial</i> takes
notice, in one of his Distichs, saying, How fast soever the Tongue
may run, the Hand runs faster<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c015'><sup>[346]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Said to have<br/>converted the<br/>Emperor</i> Philip.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i><a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c015'><sup>[347]</sup></a> and <i>Bollandus</i><a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c015'><sup>[348]</sup></a> ascribe to <i>Fabianus</i> the Conversion
of the Emperor <i>Philip</i>, and his Son; adding, from the Acts of <i>Pontius</i>
the Martyr, that he pulled down the great Temple of the <i>Romans</i>,
that he dashed to Pieces their Idols, and converted the whole City.
What a Pity that such wonderful Feats should have been passed over
in Silence by <i>Eusebius</i>, and all the Antients! As for the Conversion
of <i>Philip</i>, and his Son, it is questioned by many, and very justly, the
Silence of <i>Eusebius</i> alone being an unanswerable Evidence against it;
but all agree, that if he was instructed and converted by <i>Fabianus</i>, he
did no great Honour either to his Instructor, or his Religion. In
the Latter-end of the Year 249, the Emperor <i>Philip</i> being killed
by the rebellious Soldiery at <i>Verona</i>, <i>Decius</i>, who was raised to the
Empire in his room, began his Reign with the most dreadful Persecution
that had ever yet afflicted the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Fabianus <i>martyred in<br/>the Persecution of</i><br/>Decius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Fabianus</i> was one of
the first that fell a Victim to the implacable Hatred this Emperor bore
to the Christian Name. He was put to Death on the 20th of <i>January</i>
250. while <i>Decius</i> was Consul the second time, together with
<i>Gratus</i>, after having governed the Church Fourteen Years, one Month,
and Ten Days<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c015'><sup>[349]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The See vacant.</i><br/><br/>Year of Christ 250.<br/><img class="inline" width="80%" src="images/bracket.png" alt="bracket" /></div>

<p class='c010'>The Death of <i>Fabianus</i> was followed by a Vacancy, which lasted at
least Sixteen Months, the Christians being either imprisoned, or so
dispersed, that they could not assemble to chuse a new Bishop. During
this Interval, the Clergy, that is, the Presbyters and Deacons, took
upon themselves the Care and Administration of all Ecclesiastical Matters;
and, being informed by <i>Clementius</i>, Subdeacon of the Church
of <i>Carthage</i>, who came to <i>Rome</i> about <i>Easter</i> in 250. that St. <i>Cyprian</i>
had been obliged, by the Fury of the Persecution, to withdraw for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>while from his See, they writ to that Clergy, exhorting them to follow
their Example<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c015'><sup>[350]</sup></a>. Several excellent Letters passed on this Occasion
between the Clergy of <i>Rome</i>, and St. <i>Cyprian</i> and his Clergy,
especially concerning the Method they were to hold with the <i>Lapsed</i>;
that is, with those who had either obtained of the Pagan Magistrates
Protections, or <i>Libels of Safety</i>, whence they were called <i>Libellatici</i>,
or had actually sacrificed to Idols, and were thence named <i>Sacrificati</i>.
In one of these Letters, the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, after having maturely
examined so material a Point, and advised not only with the neighbouring
Bishops, but with others, who, from the distant Provinces,
had fled for Concealment to <i>Rome</i>, declare it was their Opinion,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Opinion of the</i><br/>Roman <i>Clergy<br/>concerning the<br/>Lapsed</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
That such of the Lapsed as were at the Point of Death, should, upon
an unfeigned Repentance, be admitted to the Communion of the
Church, but that the Cause of others should be put off till the
Election of a new Bishop, when, together with him, with other Bishops,
with the Priests, Deacons, Confessors, and Laymen, who had stood
firm, they should take their Case into Consideration; adding, that a
Crime committed by many ought not to be judged by one; and that
a Decree could not be binding without the Consent and Approbation
of many<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c015'><sup>[351]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They disown the<br/>Pope’s Infallibility.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Could they in more plain and express Terms disown the
Infallibility of the Pope their Bishop? Could they upon mature Deliberation
write thus, and at the same time believe his Judgment an
infallible Rule? Such a Proposition would, in these Days, be deemed
heretical; and no Wonder; the Pope’s Infallibility must be maintained
at all Events; and to maintain it is impossible, without condemning,
as heretical, the Doctrine taught by the Church in the first
and purest Ages.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c014'>After the See had been vacant for the Space of Sixteen Months,

Character, and, on account of his peaceable Temper, his
great Modesty, his Integrity, and many other eminent Virtues, well
worthy of the Dignity to which he was raised. He did not attain at
once, says the same Writer, to the Height of the Priesthood, but
after he had passed through all the inferior Degrees, agreeably to the
Discipline of the Church. He was so far from using Intrigues, from
intruding himself by Violence, as some have done, that Violence was
necessary to make him accept the Dignity offered him. He was ordained
Bishop, continues St. <i>Cyprian</i>, by some of our Collegues,
who, being then at <i>Rome</i>, conformed to the Judgment of the whole
People and Clergy<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c015'><sup>[355]</sup></a>. As <i>Decius</i> was still alive, who had declared,
that he had rather bear with a Competitor to his Crown, than with a
Bishop of <i>Rome</i><a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c015'><sup>[356]</sup></a>, the Christians, in all Likelihood, laid hold of the
Opportunity, which the Revolt of <i>Valens</i> gave them, to chuse a new
Bishop; for this very Year <i>Julius Valens</i> revolting, caused himself to
be proclaimed Emperor in <i>Rome</i><a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c015'><sup>[357]</sup></a>; and though he held the Empire
but a very short time, yet his Revolt might divert <i>Decius</i> for a while
from persecuting the Christians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Novatian</div>

<p class='c001'>Though <i>Cornelius</i> was chosen by the unanimous Voice of the
People and Clergy, yet <i>Novatian</i>, a Presbyter of the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, who aspired to the same Dignity, not only refused to acknowlege
him; but having gained a considerable Party among the People,
Five Presbyters, and some Confessors, he wrote in their Name and his
own to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and no doubt to many other Bishops, laying
heinous Crimes to the Charge of <i>Cornelius</i>; namely, his having sued
for a Protection from the Pagan Magistrates, which was ranking him
among the <i>Libellatici</i>, who were excluded from all Dignities and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Employments in the Church. St. <i>Cyprian</i> having received this Letter,
and at the same time one from <i>Cornelius</i>, acquainting him with his
Election, as was customary in those Times among Bishops, he caused
the one to be read in a full Assembly of the People and Clergy, but
suppressed the other, looking upon it as a scandalous Libel<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c015'><sup>[358]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St.</i> Cyprian <i>calls a<br/>Council</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However,
to prevent the Calumnies and false Reports that might be spread
abroad by <i>Novatian</i> and his Partisans, he assembled a Council of
all the Bishops of his Province, who, hearing of the Schism in the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, resolved to send thither two of their Body, who
should carefully inform themselves of what had passed in the late
Election, and on their Return make a faithful Report of all they had
learnt. Pursuant to this Resolution, <i>Caldonius</i> and <i>Fortunatus</i>, Two
<i>African</i> Bishops, were dispatched to <i>Rome</i> with Letters from the
Council to the Clergy of that City, and to the Bishops who had been
present at the Ordination of <i>Cornelius</i>. The Bishops no sooner received
these Letters than they answered them, assuring their Brethren
in <i>Africa</i>, that <i>Cornelius</i> had been lawfully chosen; and at the same
time commending him as a Person, on account of his extraordinary
Piety, and exemplary Life, most worthy of the Dignity to which he
had been raised. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which acknowleges</i><br/>Cornelius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Their Testimony was soon after confirmed by
<i>Caldonius</i> and <i>Fortunatus</i> returning from <i>Rome</i>, and like wise by <i>Stephanius</i>
and <i>Pompeius</i>, Two <i>African</i> Bishops, who had assisted at the
Ordination of <i>Cornelius</i>; so that he was universally acknowleged all
over <i>Africa</i><a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c015'><sup>[359]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <i>African</i> Bishops no sooner acknowleged <i>Cornelius</i> than they
acquainted him with the Resolutions, which they had taken in their
late Council, with respect to the Lapsed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Resolutions of the<br/>Council of</i> Africa<br/><i>concerning the<br/>Lapsed</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Substance of these was,
That such as had yielded to the Fury of the Persecution ought not
to be abandoned, lest, giving themselves up to Despair, they should
fall into a total Apostasy; but should be re-admitted to the Union of
the Church upon a sincere Repentance, and after a long Penance;
that the Time of their Penance should be shortened, or prolonged,
according to the Nature of their Crimes; that is, the <i>Libellatici</i>
should have a shorter Time assigned them; and the <i>Sacrificati</i>, called
also <i>Thurificati</i>, who had actually offered Sacrifice, or Frankincense,
to Idols, should not be admitted till they had expiated their Offence by
a very long Penance; but that both the <i>Libellatici</i> and <i>Sacrificati</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>should be taken in, before the Time of their Penance was expired,
if at the Point of Death, or even thought to be in Danger<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c015'><sup>[360]</sup></a>. As to
fallen Bishops, they were to be dealt with in the same Manner; and,
after due Penance, or, as it is sometimes called, Satisfaction, be
admitted only in a Lay Capacity<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c015'><sup>[361]</sup></a>. <i>Cornelius</i> did not, upon the Receipt
of these Determinations or Decrees, step into his oracular Chair, and
thence, as an infallible Judge, condemn or approve them. Such
arbitrary Proceedings would not have been well relished by the
Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, nor even by his own Clergy, who not long before
had declared, That <i>a Decree could not be binding without the Consent
and Approbation of many</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Which are approved<br/>by the Council<br/>of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He therefore acted on this Occasion as
St. <i>Cyprian</i> had done, as other Bishops did afterwards; that is, he
assembled a Council, which <i>Eusebius</i> calls <i>a great Council</i><a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c015'><sup>[362]</sup></a>; for it
consisted of Sixty Bishops, and a great Number of Priests, Deacons,
and Laymen, who, in those Times, were admitted to all Councils<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c015'><sup>[363]</sup></a>.
By this Venerable Assembly were the Decrees of the Council of <i>Africa</i>
examined and approved, and then sent to be in like manner examined
and approved by other Bishops, till the whole Church had agreed to
them<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c015'><sup>[364]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Novatian <i>excommun-<br/>icated</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>At the Council of <i>Rome</i> assisted among other Presbyters <i>Novatian</i>:
but as he maintained, in Opposition to the whole Assembly, that
the Lapsed were to be admitted upon no Terms or Satisfaction whatsoever,
but should be left to the Divine Tribunal, he was himself cut
off from that Communion, which with an invincible Obstinacy he
denied to others<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c015'><sup>[365]</sup></a>. Provoked at this Sentence, he readily gave Ear to
the Insinuations of <i>Novatus</i>, a Presbyter of the Church of <i>Carthage</i>,
who had fled from thence to <i>Rome</i>, to avoid the Sentence of Excommunication,
with which he was threatened by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and the
other Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, for his scandalous Doctrine, and irregular
Practices<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c015'><sup>[366]</sup></a>. <i>Pacianus</i> paints him in the blacked Colours:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Novatus <i>his Wicked<br/>ness</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He stripped
the Orphans, says he, plundered the Widows of the Church of <i>Carthage</i>,
and appropriated to himself the Money belonging to the Poor
and the Church<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c015'><sup>[367]</sup></a>: He turned his Father out of Doors, and let him die
of Hunger in the Streets, and would not even be at the Trouble of
burying him after his Death. With a Kick in the Belly he made his
Wife miscarry, and bring forth a dead Child: whence <i>Pacianus</i> calls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>him a Traitor, an Assassin, the Murderer of his Father and Child<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c015'><sup>[368]</sup></a>. As
for his Doctrine, he held, while at <i>Carthage</i>, Tenets diametrically
opposite to those he taught at <i>Rome</i>: for, at <i>Carthage</i>, he was for
admitting to the Communion of the Church not only the Lapsed, but
all other Sinners, let their Crimes be ever so heinous, without any
Sort of Penance; and, at <i>Rome</i>, for excluding them, let their Penance
be ever so long, let their Repentance be ever so sincere<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c015'><sup>[369]</sup></a>. At <i>Carthage</i>
he found <i>Felicissimus</i>, of whom I shall speak hereafter, inclined to
Lenity; and <i>Novatian</i>, at <i>Rome</i>, to Severity: and therefore, as
he was a Man of great Vanity, and no Principles, he suited himself
to the different Tempers of such as he judged the most capable of
raising him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He gains many<br/>Followers, and some<br/>Confessors, to the<br/>Party of</i> Novatian.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At <i>Rome</i>, by a Pretence to an uncommon Sanctity and
Severity, he gained a great many Followers, and among them some
Confessors lately delivered out of Prison, from whom he extorted
Letters directed to <i>Novatian</i>, wherein they consented to the Ordination
of the said <i>Novatian</i>. In virtue of these Letters he was
accordingly ordained, some say in <i>Rome</i><a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c015'><sup>[370]</sup></a>, others in a neighbouring
Village<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c015'><sup>[371]</sup></a>, by Three Bishops sent for by <i>Novatus</i> out of the Country
for that Purpose, and quite unacquainted with his Views.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Novatian <i>the<br/>first</i> Anti-pope.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Being
thus ordained Bishop, he was set up by the Party against <i>Cornelius</i>,
whom they charged with relaxing the Discipline of the Church, and
communicating with the Lapsed, especially with one <i>Trophimus</i>.
This St. <i>Cyprian</i> calls a false and groundless Charge; for, as to <i>Trophimus</i>,
though he was in the Number of the <i>Thurificati</i>, that is,
though he had offered Frankinsense to Idols, and even persuaded his
Flock (for he was a Presbyter, if not a Bishop) to follow his Example,
yet he had sufficiently atoned for his Crime, by a sincere Repentance,
by a long Penance, and, above all, by bringing back his People with
him, who would not have returned without him<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c015'><sup>[372]</sup></a>. As for the
others, 'tis true, he communicated with some who had not fulfilled the
Time of Penance assigned them, but such only as, being admitted at
the Point of Death, had afterwards recovered; which can no otherwise
be avoided, says St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c015'><sup>[373]</sup></a>, but by killing those to whom we
granted the Peace of the Church, when we apprehended them to be
in Danger. <i>Novatian</i> having thus, by a pretended Zeal for the
Discipline of the Church, and the artful Insinuations of <i>Novatus</i>,
seduced a great many at <i>Rome</i>, who styled themselves the <i>Cathari</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He acquaints the<br/>other Churches with<br/>his Ordination.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that is, the pure, undefiled Party; he wrote in their and his own
Name to the other Churches, acquainting them with his Ordination,
exhorting them not to communicate with the Lapsed upon any Terms,
and bitterly complaining of the scandalous Lenity and Remisness of
<i>Cornelius</i><a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c015'><sup>[374]</sup></a>. At the same time <i>Cornelius</i> wrote to the other Bishops,
giving them a faithful Account of all that had happened at <i>Rome</i>,
especially of the uncanonical Ordination of <i>Novatian</i>. However,
the Letters of <i>Novatian</i>, signed by several Confessors, who were
greatly respected in those Days, made no small Impression on <i>Antonianus</i>
an <i>African</i> Bishop, and <i>Fabius</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i><a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c015'><sup>[375]</sup></a>, but quite
gained over to the Party <i>Marcianus</i> Bishop of <i>Arles</i><a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c015'><sup>[376]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Deputies rejected<br/>and excommunicated<br/>in</i> Africa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The other
Bishops declared all to a Man for <i>Cornelius</i>, especially St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and
those of his Province, who, being assembled in a Council when the
Deputies of <i>Novatian</i> arrived, excommunicated without farther
Examination both him and them<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c015'><sup>[377]</sup></a>; and well they might, since they
had taken so much Pains to inform themselves of the Lawfulness of
<i>Cornelius</i>’s Election, as we have related above. The Deputies, though
thus rejected with Scorn and Disgrace by the Council, did not abandon
the Enterprize, but proselyting from Town to Town, nay, from
House to House, inveigled a great many, under colour of communicating
with the Confessors<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c015'><sup>[378]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St.</i> Cyprian<i>endeav-<br/>ours to reclaim<br/>the Confessors</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  St. <i>Cyprian</i> therefore, whose Zeal
was not confined within the Bounds, however extensive, of <i>Africa</i>, <i>Numidia</i>, and the Two <i>Mauritania</i>’s, to withdraw this main Support
from the Party, writ a short but nervous Letter to the Confessors,
deploring the Fault they had committed, by consenting to the unlawful
Ordination of <i>Novatian</i>, and exhorting them to return with all
Speed to the Catholic Church<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c015'><sup>[379]</sup></a>. <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>
writ them a pathetic Letter to the same Purpose<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c015'><sup>[380]</sup></a>; and these Letters
had at last the desired Effect; but not before <i>Novatus</i>, who had
drawn them into the Schism, left <i>Rome</i>; which happened on the following
Occasion:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Novatian <i>sends new<br/>Deputies into</i> Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Novatian</i>, being informed that the Deputies he had sent into
<i>Africa</i> were every-where rejected and despised, resolved to send others,
whom he judged, on account of their Rank and Authority, more
capable of promoting his Design<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c015'><sup>[381]</sup></a>. The Persons he pitched upon
were <i>Nicostratus</i>, <i>Novatus</i>, <i>Evaristus</i>, <i>Primus</i>, and <i>Dionysius</i>. Of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the Two last I find no farther Mention made in History; of <i>Novatus</i>
I have spoken above; and as for <i>Evaristus</i> and <i>Nicostratus</i>, the
former was a Bishop, and is supposed to have been one of the Three
that ordained <i>Novatian</i>. <i>Nicostratus</i> was a Deacon of the Church
of <i>Rome</i><a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c015'><sup>[382]</sup></a>, and had been imprisoned with the Two Presbyters <i>Moses</i>
and <i>Maximus</i>, for the Confession of the Faith<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c015'><sup>[383]</sup></a>, which intitled him
to a Place among the Confessors.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their Characters.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  To these Three St. <i>Cyprian</i> ascribes
the excellent Letter, as he styles it, which the Confessors of <i>Rome</i>
writ to those of <i>Carthage</i><a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c015'><sup>[384]</sup></a>. He was likewise one of the Confessors,
who writ to St. <i>Cyprian</i> himself, as appears from the Title of that
admirable Letter, which runs thus: <i>The Presbyters</i> Moses <i>and</i> Maximus,
<i>the Deacons</i> Nicostratus <i>and</i> Ruffinus, <i>and the other Confessors,
who are with them, to Pope</i> Cyprian<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c015'><sup>[385]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Name of Pope<br/>antiently common to<br/>all Bishops.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  We may here observe, by
the way, that the Name of <i>Pope</i>, which signifies no more than <i>Father</i>,
was antiently common to all Bishops; but was afterwards, by
a special Decree of <i>Gregory</i> VII. appropriated to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>.
To return to <i>Nicostratus</i>, the Character given him by St. <i>Cyprian</i> and
<i>Cornelius</i>, bespeaks him quite unworthy of being joined with the
others, who are named in that Letter, and were all Men of great
Piety: for he had squandered away the Money belonging to the
Church, that was lodged in his Hands, embezzled that of the Widows
and Orphans, and defrauded a Lady, who had trusted him with
the Management of her Affairs<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c015'><sup>[386]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Deputies are<br/>everywhere rejected<br/>in</i> Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'>These new Deputies met with no better a Reception than the
former had done: for St. <i>Cyprian</i>, being informed of their Departure
from <i>Rome</i>, by the Confessor <i>Augendus</i><a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c015'><sup>[387]</sup></a>, and soon after of their
Characters by the Acolyte <i>Nicephorus</i>, both sent, for that Purpose,
by <i>Cornelius</i><a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c015'><sup>[388]</sup></a>, he acquainted therewith the other Catholic Bishops,
who, upon that Intelligence, rejected them with the greatest Indignation,
as Apostates, and Firebrands of Sedition. Hereupon the Deputies
having, by the Means and Contrivance of <i>Novatus</i>, procured
some of their Party to be ordained Bishops, and <i>Nicostratus</i> among
the rest, they named them to the Sees of the Catholic Bishops; which
bred great Confusion and Disorder in the Church, it being a difficult
Matter for the Bishops in the distant Provinces to distinguish between
their lawful Brethren and the Intruders, and consequently to
know whom they should admit to, and whom they should exclude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>from their Communion. But against this Evil a Remedy was found
by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and the other <i>African</i> Bishops, who, to arm him
against the Craft and Arts of those subtle Impostors, transmitted to
him a List of all the Catholic Bishops of that Province<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c015'><sup>[389]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Confessors return<br/>to the Communion of<br/>the Church.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Storm, which <i>Novatus</i> had raised in <i>Rome</i>, was laid by his
Departure; for he was no sooner gone, than the Confessors, whom he
had seduced, <i>viz.</i> <i>Maximus</i>, <i>Urbanus</i>, <i>Sidonius</i>, and <i>Macarius</i>, signified
to <i>Cornelius</i> their eager Desire of quitting his Party, and returning
to the Communion of the Church. <i>Cornelius</i> questioned, at
first, their Sincerity; but, being convinced of it at last, he assembled
his Clergy, not caring to trust to his own Judgment, in order to
advise with them, in what manner he should proceed, in the present
Case. At this Council assisted, besides the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, Five
Bishops, who either happened to be then at <i>Rome</i>; or, on this Occasion,
had been invited thither by <i>Cornelius</i>. They were scarce met,
when the Confessors, attended by a great Croud, appeared before them,
testifying, with a Flood of Tears, the Sincerity of their Repentance,
and begging they would forget their part criminal Conduct. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How received.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The
Council did not think it adviseable to come to any Resolution, till
they had acquainted the People with the Request of the Confessors;
which they no sooner did, than the People flocked to the Place, and,
not upbraiding, but embracing, with Tears of Joy, their retrieved
Brethren, and with the same Tenderness as if they had been just
then delivered out of Prison, pointed out to the Council the Method
they were to pursue. Accordingly <i>Cornelius</i>, having, with the Approbation
of the Council, made them renounce the Errors of <i>Novatian</i>,
and acknowlege him for the only lawful Bishop of <i>Rome</i>,
readmitted them, without farther Satisfaction, to the Communion of
the Church<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c015'><sup>[390]</sup></a>. From this Account I should imagine, that those who
accompanied the Confessors, at their first appearing before the Council,
were <i>Novatians</i>, whom they had brought back with them; but
I dare not affirm it, since St. <i>Cyprian</i>, in his Answer to <i>Cornelius</i>,
speaks only of the Four above-mentioned Confessors.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cornelius <i>acquaints<br/>St.</i> Cyprian <i>with<br/>their Return</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Confessors
being thus returned, to the inexpressible Joy of the whole People,
<i>Cornelius</i>, impatient to impart the good News to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, writ
to him, as soon as the Council broke up, to acquaint him with what
had happened, and invite him to partake of the common Joy, to
which he had so much contributed<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c015'><sup>[391]</sup></a>. With this Letter <i>Nicephorus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the Acolyte embarked, without Delay, for <i>Africa</i>; and thence returned
soon after with an Answer, wherein St. <i>Cyprian</i> assured <i>Cornelius</i>,
that, the Return of the Confessors had caused an universal Joy in
<i>Africa</i>, both for their Sake, and because it might open the Eyes of
many, and prove in the End the Ruin of the schismatic Party<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c015'><sup>[392]</sup></a>. The
Confessors themselves writ to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, upon their Return<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c015'><sup>[393]</sup></a>, who
immediately answered them<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c015'><sup>[394]</sup></a>; and, in all Likelihood, to the other
chief Bishops of the Church; since <i>Eusebius</i> informs us, that <i>Dionysius</i>,
Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, writ twice to them after their Return<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c015'><sup>[395]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>In what manner</i><br/>Novatian <i>endeavoured<br/>to keep the rest<br/>steady</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>In the mean time <i>Novatian</i>, seeing great Numbers, moved by the
Example of the Confessors, daily fall off from his Party, to keep the
rest steady by the most sacred Ties, used, in administring the Eucharist,
to hold the Hands of those who received it, with the holy Bread
in them, between his, and oblige them to swear, <i>by the Body and
Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, that they would never abandon him,
nor return to <i>Cornelius</i><a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c015'><sup>[396]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Schism in the<br/>Church of</i> Carthage.</div>

<p class='c001'>As the Church of <i>Rome</i> was rent by the Schism of <i>Novatian</i>, so
was the Church of <i>Carthage</i> by that of <i>Felicissimus</i>; and as the former,
upon his being excommunicated by <i>Cornelius</i>, and the Council of
<i>Rome</i>, had recourse to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, in like manner the latter, being
cut off from the Communion of the Church by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and the
Council of <i>Carthage</i>, had recourse to <i>Cornelius</i>. But as the Doctrine
of <i>Felicissimus</i>, though diametrically opposite to that of <i>Novatian</i>,
was equally repugnant to the Catholic Truth, and to the Discipline established
in the Church, as I have observed above, he was at first rejected
by <i>Cornelius</i>, with great Steadiness and Resolution. But the
Bishop of <i>Rome</i> had, at last, been frightened into a Compliance, had
he not been animated and encouraged by St. <i>Cyprian</i>: for the Followers
of <i>Felicissimus</i> having, in Imitation of the <i>Novatians</i>, appointed
one of their own Faction, named <i>Fortunatus</i>, Bishop of
<i>Carthage</i>, <i>Felicissimus</i> took upon himself to carry to <i>Cornelius</i> the
Letters of the new and Third Bishop of that City. Accordingly he
set out for <i>Rome</i>, attended by a Troop of seditious, desperate, and
abandoned Men, says St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c015'><sup>[397]</sup></a>. <i>Cornelius</i> rejected them at first
with great Firmness, and immediately acquainted St. <i>Cyprian</i> with
what had passed; but <i>Felicissimus</i> threatening to read publicly the
Letters he had brought, if <i>Cornelius</i> did not receive them, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>discover many scandalous Things, he was not a little intimidated. He
therefore writ a second Letter to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, but betrayed in it a
great deal of Fear and Weakness: however, the excellent Letter,
which St. <i>Cyprian</i> writ in Answer to his, inspired him with new
Vigour, and kept him steady<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c015'><sup>[398]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Persecution<br/>renewed by</i> Gallus.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the mean time, <i>Decius</i> being killed, the Persecution was carried
on, or rather renewed, with more Fury than ever, by <i>Gallus</i>
his Successor. As the <i>Roman</i> Empire was, at this Time, afflicted
with a dreadful Plague, <i>Gallus</i>, who, it seems, had not molested the
Christians during the first Months of his Reign<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c015'><sup>[399]</sup></a>, issued an Order,
injoining Men of all Ranks and Professions to offer Sacrifice to the
Gods, hoping, by that means, to appease their Wrath, and put a Stop
to the raging Evil. It was on Occasion of this Plague that St. <i>Cyprian</i>
writ his excellent Discourse on <i>Mortality</i>, wherein he so eloquently
teaches a Christian to triumph over the Fears of Death, and
shews with how little Reason we mourn for those Friends and
Relations who are snatched from us. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cornelius<br/><i>apprehended</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Such of the Christians as refused
to comply with the Emperor’s Edict, were either banished or executed.
<i>Cornelius</i>, among the rest, was apprehended at the first breaking out
of the Persecution, and made a glorious Confession of his Faith, as
appears from St. <i>Cyprian</i>, who, on that Occasion, writ him a Letter
of Congratulation<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c015'><sup>[400]</sup></a>. What happened to him afterwards is uncertain;
for his Acts are evidently fabulous, though they have been received
by <i>Bede</i>, by <i>Ado</i>, by <i>Anastasius</i>, and many others, far more considerable
for their Number than their Authority. We read in the
Pontifical of <i>Bucherius</i>, that he was banished to <i>Centumcellæ</i>, now
<i>Civita-vecchia</i>, and died of a natural Death, according to the Expression
used there<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c015'><sup>[401]</sup></a> (<i>Dormitionem accepit</i>). As to the Title of
Martyr, with which he is distinguished by St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c015'><sup>[402]</sup></a>, it was antiently
given to all those who, for the Confession of Faith, died in Prison,
which in all Likelihood happened to <i>Cornelius</i><a id='rN5' /><a href='#fN5' class='c015'><sup>[N5]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN5'>N5</a>. <i>Cornelius</i> is reckoned, by St. <i>Jerom</i>,
among the Ecclesiastic Writers, on account
of the Four Letters, which he writ
to <i>Fabius</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, who seemed
not to dislike the Tenets of <i>Novatian</i><a id='rN5.1' /><a href='#fN5.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

and published by Father <i>du Bosc</i>, the Cardinals
<i>Baronius</i><a id='rN5.3' /><a href='#fN5.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and <i>Bona</i><a id='rN5.4' /><a href='#fN5.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> think it
genuine; but it is, without all Doubt, supposititious:
for, according to <i>Ado</i> and <i>Baronius</i>
himself<a id='rN5.5' /><a href='#fN5.5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, <i>Florentius</i>, whom <i>Lupicinus</i>
is supposed to have succeeded, was
raised to that See in the Reign of <i>Maximus</i>,
or <i>Gordian</i>, about the Year 240. and held
it till the Reign of <i>Valerian</i>, and about the
Year 258. so that in 252. when <i>Cornelius</i>
died, <i>Lupicinus</i> was not yet Bishop. Besides,
in the Title of the Letter, which <i>Baronius</i>
has suppressed, <i>Lupicinus</i> is styled
<i>Archbishop</i>; which Title was not known
then, nor long after. The Letter is therefore
rejected by <i>Launoy</i><a id='rN5.6' /><a href='#fN5.6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, and Dr. <i>Pearson</i><a id='rN5.7' /><a href='#fN5.7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>,
as a forged and spurious Piece.

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Stephen</i>, who succeeded <i>Lucius</i>, in 253. soon after his
Election, received a Letter from <i>Faustinus</i>, Bishop of <i>Lions</i>,
written in the Name of all his Collegues in <i>Gaul</i>, informing him, that
<i>Marcian</i>, Bishop of <i>Arles</i>, having embraced the Doctrine of <i>Novatian</i>,
had denied the Communion of the Church to the Lapsed, even
at the Point of Death. At the same time they writ to St. <i>Cyprian</i>,
and on the same Subject<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c015'><sup>[415]</sup></a>, not caring to come to any vigorous Resolution
against their Collegue, without the Advice and Approbation of
other Bishops, especially of <i>Rome</i> and <i>Carthage</i>; the former being
eminent for the Dignity of his See, and the latter for his known
Zeal, Piety, and Learning. But <i>Faustinus</i> did not find in the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i> the Zeal he expected; and therefore he writ a second Letter
to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, exhorting him to animate the others by his Example<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c015'><sup>[416]</sup></a>;
which that zealous Prelate did accordingly: for he writ
immediately to <i>Stephen</i>, pressing him to dispatch, without Delay,
full and ample Letters to the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>; that, finding themselves
thus backed and supported, they might thereby be encouraged
to depose <i>Marcian</i>, and name another in his room. It is not to be
doubted but the Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, who had the Welfare of the
Church, at least, as much at Heart as the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, did himself
what he encouraged the others to do; but I cannot positively
affirm it, since his Answer to <i>Faustinus</i> is lost. As to the Issue of this
Affair, the Antients have left us quite in the Dark<a id='rN7' /><a href='#fN7' class='c015'><sup>[N7]</sup></a>.</p>

the Bishops of <i>Arles</i>, published by F. <i>Mabillon</i>:
whence some modern Writers have
concluded, that he was actually deposed;
but that List is very imperfect, the Names
of many Bishops being wanting there, whom
we certainly know to have governed that
Church.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c016' />

</div>

<p class='c001'>St. <i>Cyprian</i> did not doubt in the least but that <i>Marcian</i> would be

that he may not be at a Loss, to whom he should direct his Letters,
and his Brethren<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c015'><sup>[417]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><i>Faustinus</i>, and the other Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, did not apply, on this
Occasion, to <i>Stephen</i> alone, but to him, and to St. <i>Cyprian</i>. Why
then should their applying to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> be construed, as it
is, by all the Roman Catholic Writers, into a tacit Acknowlegement
of his universal Jurisdiction, and not the like Construction be put on
their applying to the Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>? But, in Truth, neither
can bear such a Construction, since the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i> did not refer
the Cause of <i>Marcian</i> either to <i>Stephen</i>, or to St. <i>Cyprian</i>: they
writ to both only for their Advice and Approbation. <i>Stephen</i> was
backward, for Reasons unknown to us, in giving his; and therefore
St. <i>Cyprian</i>, in a Letter, which he writ on this Occasion, pressed
him to encourage with his Letters the People of <i>Arles</i>, and the Bishops
of <i>Gaul</i>, to depose <i>Marcian</i>, and appoint another in his room<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c015'><sup>[418]</sup></a>.
Was not this plainly acknowleging, not in the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, but
in the People and Clergy, the Power of deposing one Bishop, and
appointing another in his room?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stephen<i>’s rash Con-<br/>duct</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>But to return to <i>Stephen</i>: His rash Conduct had involved the Churches
of <i>Spain</i> in endless Calamities, had not St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and the other
Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, zealously interposed. The Bishops of <i>Spain</i>, having
judged Two of their Collegues unworthy of the Episcopacy, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Basilides</i> of <i>Leon</i> and <i>Astorga</i>, and <i>Martial</i> of <i>Merida</i>, had disposed
of their Sees to others, appointing <i>Sabinus</i> in the room of the former,
and <i>Felix</i> in that of the latter. They were both <i>Libellatici</i>, and
guilty of many other Crimes, for which <i>Martial</i> had been deposed;
but <i>Basilides</i>, returning to himself, and conscious of his own Guilt,
had voluntarily resigned, declaring he should think it a great Happiness
to be readmitted, after due Satisfaction, to the Communion of
the Church, even in the Capacity of a Layman. But, Ambition getting
the better of all his good Resolutions, he soon began to pant
after his former Condition; and, thinking the Favour and Interest of
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> might greatly contribute to his Re-establishment,
he undertook a Journey to that City; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He suffers himself<br/>to be imposed upon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> and there, as St. <i>Cyprian</i> expresses
himself, <i>imposed upon our Collegue</i> Stephen, <i>who lived at a
great Distance, and was ignorant of the Truth, seeking unjustly
to be restored to his Bishoprick, from which he had been justly
deposed</i><a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c015'><sup>[419]</sup></a>. Being thus admitted to the Communion of the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>, he returned well satisfied to <i>Spain</i>, and there exercised all
Episcopal Functions, as he had formerly done. St. <i>Cyprian</i> does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>tell us, in express Terms, that <i>Martial</i> too had recourse to <i>Rome</i>;
but that he had, may, perhaps, be gathered from his Words; for
he writes, that, notwithstanding the Craft and Deceit <i>Martial</i> had
used, probably in imposing upon <i>Stephen</i>, he had not been able to
preserve his Episcopacy<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c015'><sup>[420]</sup></a>. Besides, he acted as a Bishop after he had
been deposed by a Synod; which he would have hardly attempted,
had he not been countenanced by some Bishop of Rank and Dignity.
Be that as it will, the Churches of <i>Leon</i>, <i>Astorga</i>, and <i>Merida</i>, applied,
in this their Distress, to the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, imploring, both
by Letters and Deputies, their Advice and Assistance. The Deputies
were the Two new Bishops <i>Felix</i> and <i>Sabinus</i>; and their Deputation
was backed by a pressing Letter from <i>Felix</i>, Bishop of <i>Saragosa</i>,
whom St. <i>Cyprian</i> styles a Propagator of the Faith, and Defender of
the Truth<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c015'><sup>[421]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Martial <i>of</i> Merida<br/> <i>excommunicated by<br/> the Bishops of</i> Africa,<br/> <i>tho’ admitted by</i><br/> Stephen <i>to his<br/> Communion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
These Letters being read at <i>Carthage</i>, in a Council of
28 Bishops, with St. <i>Cyprian</i> at their Head, it was concluded, that <i>Basilides</i>
and <i>Martial</i> ought not to be acknowleged as Bishops; that it
was not lawful to communicate with them; that such Bishops as did,
ought to be excommunicated themselves; and, finally, that their
imposing upon <i>Stephen</i>, instead of giving them any kind of Right to
the Sees they had forfeited by their Wickedness, added to their Guilt.
By the same Council, the Election of <i>Sabinus</i> and <i>Felix</i> was confirmed,
and they acknowleged by all the <i>African</i> Bishops as their
Collegues<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c015'><sup>[422]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Appeals to</i> Rome,<br/><i>no Proof of the Pope’s<br/>Supremacy</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It is surprising, that <i>Bellarmine</i>, <i>Baronius</i>, <i>Davidius</i>, and other
Advocates for the Pope’s Supremacy, should lay so much Stress as they
do, on the Recourse to <i>Rome</i> of the Two deposed Bishops. If their
recurring, or appealing, as they are pleased to style it, to the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>, is any Proof of his being acknowleged by them for the
Head of the Church, the Appeal of the other Bishops of <i>Spain</i> from
him to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and their acquiescing to his, and not to the Judgment
of <i>Stephen</i>, will be a stronger Proof of St. <i>Cyprian</i>’s being
acknowleged by them for the Head of the Church. Had <i>Basilides</i>
and <i>Martial</i> recurred not to <i>Rome</i>, but to <i>Carthage</i>, had the Bishops
of <i>Spain</i> appealed from St. <i>Cyprian</i> to <i>Stephen</i>, as they did from <i>Stephen</i>
to St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and acquiesced to his Judgment, no Notice had
been taken of the Appeal of the Two Apostates; that only of the
Catholic Bishops had been set forth with great Pomp and Flourish of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Words. But, as the Case stands, they must be satisfied with the Evidence
of the Apostates, and leave the Catholic Bishops to bear Testimony
for us, which we shall not misuse; we shall not build upon
it the Supremacy of the Church of <i>Carthage</i>; we shall not set up
St. <i>Cyprian</i> for a Judge, to whose Tribunal all Appeals must be
brought; in short, we shall not make him an universal Judge, an
universal Pastor, a Pope; though, to the Testimony of the <i>Spanish</i>
Bishops, that of <i>Gregory Nazianzene</i> should be added, and I defy
the Champions for the See of <i>Rome</i> to allege one in their Favour
more plain and expressive: <i>St.</i> Cyprian, says he, <i>presided not only
over the Church of</i> Carthage, <i>or that of</i> Africa, <i>on which he reflected
an extraordinary Lustre, but over all the West, nay, and over all
the Nations of the East, of the North, and the South</i><a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c015'><sup>[423]</sup></a>. Had <i>Gregory</i>
said as much of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, the Passage had been employed
as a Corner-stone to support the Pope’s universal Jurisdiction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The famous Dispute<br/>about the Baptism<br/>of Heretics.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Not long after the Affair of the <i>Spanish</i> Bishops, that is, about the
Year 256. according to the most probable Opinion, happened the
famous Contest about the Baptism of Heretics, which rent the whole
Church into Two Parties, the one headed by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and the
other by <i>Stephen</i>. St. <i>Cyprian</i> maintained, that Baptism administred
by Heretics, was null and invalid; and, consequently, that such as
came over from them, from what Sect soever they came, ought to
be baptized by a Catholic Minister: he owned there was but one
Baptism, and therefore avoided the Word <i>Rebaptization</i>; but thought
that Heretics had not the Power of conferring it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Both Opinions<br/>erroneous.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  On the other
hand, <i>Stephen</i>, and those who adhered to him, pretended, that Baptism
conferred by Heretics, of whatever Sect or Persuasion, was valid;
so that by avoiding one Error, they fell into another; for some
Heretics of those Times, namely, the <i>Montanists</i> and <i>Marcionites</i>,
did not baptize, as is commanded by the Gospel, in the Name of
the Three Persons; whence their Baptism was declared null by Two
Oecumenical Councils, as I shall relate hereafter. I know great Pains
have been taken to excuse <i>Stephen</i>; but his own Words, quoted by
St. <i>Cyprian</i>, from his own Letter to him, can, in my Opinion,
admit of no Dispute; for he there forbids, in express Terms, the Baptizing
of Heretics, <i>from what Heresy soever they should come</i><a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c015'><sup>[424]</sup></a>. And
here we may observe, by the way, that the whole Church erred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>either at this Time, or afterwards; for afterwards both Opinions were
condemned, and both were held at this Time, by the one or the
other of the Two Parties, into which the whole Church was divided.
The Point in Dispute had been canvassed long before, and differently
settled in different Provinces. The Churches of <i>Africa</i> and <i>Numidia</i>
had formerly admitted Heretics, without baptizing or rebaptizing
them; but the contrary Practice was established in a Council of
the Bishops of these Two Provinces, summoned about the Close of
the Second Century, by <i>Agrippinus</i> Bishop of <i>Carthage</i><a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c015'><sup>[425]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Custom of<br/>baptizing Heretics<br/>practised by several<br/>Churches, and<br/>established by<br/>Councils</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The same
Practice of baptizing Heretics was followed by the Churches of <i>Cappadocia</i>,
and the other Provinces of <i>Asia</i>, as a Tradition handed
down to them from the Apostles Times; whence it was confirmed in
a Council, which was held at <i>Iconium</i> in <i>Phrygia</i>, about the Year
230. and consisted of all the Bishops of <i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Galatia</i>, <i>Cilicia</i>,
and the neighbouring Provinces<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c015'><sup>[426]</sup></a>. The same Practice was approved
of by another Council, assembled, much about the same time, at
<i>Synnades</i> in <i>Phrygia</i><a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c015'><sup>[427]</sup></a>. The Bishops of <i>Pontus</i> and <i>Egypt</i> agreed, it
seems, with those of <i>Cappadocia</i> and <i>Galatia</i><a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c015'><sup>[428]</sup></a>; but all the other
Bishops, especially those of <i>Italy</i>, <i>Gaul</i>, and <i>Spain</i>, held the contrary
Opinion, and followed the opposite Practice. This Disagreement,
both in Opinion and Practice, had hitherto created no Disturbance
in the Church, each Bishop conforming to the Custom of his
particular Church, as received by Tradition, or settled by Synods,
without censuring those who disagreed with him, or being censured
by them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>It is confirm’d<br/>by two Councils held<br/>by St.</i> Cyprian;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But the Question was now revived by Eighteen Bishops of
<i>Numidia</i>, who writ to a Council, held at this time by St. <i>Cyprian</i>,
to know whether they had done well in rebaptizing Heretics, agreeably
to the antient Practice of their respective Churches. What raised
this Doubt now, we know not; but it is certain, the Council answered,
that they ought to follow the Practice which they had hitherto observed<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c015'><sup>[429]</sup></a>.
The same Answer was returned by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, to <i>Quintus</i>
Bishop of <i>Mauritania</i>, who had asked the same Question<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c015'><sup>[430]</sup></a>. Soon
after, another Council was held at <i>Carthage</i>, composed of 71 Bishops,
wherein the Decrees of the former Council, concerning the Baptism
of Heretics, were confirmed; and besides, it was ordained, that such
Presbyters and Deacons as had received Ordination at the Hands of
Heretics, or who, after receiving Orders in the Church, had fallen into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Heresy, should be admitted to Communion only as Laymen<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c015'><sup>[431]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who acquaints</i><br/>Stephen <i>with their<br/>Decrees</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
Council, by a synodal Letter, acquainted <i>Stephen</i> with these Resolutions,
hoping he would approve and embrace them; but at the
same time declaring, that if any Bishop should think fit to reject
them, and follow different Opinions, agreeably to the Liberty they
all claimed, no Breach of Peace and Unity should thence follow on
their Side<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c015'><sup>[432]</sup></a>. With this Letter St. <i>Cyprian</i> sent those he had written to
<i>Quintus</i>, and to the Bishops of <i>Numidia</i><a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c015'><sup>[433]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St.</i> Cyprian<i>’s famous<br/>letter to</i> Jubaianus.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was after this Council, and before <i>Stephen</i>’s Answer, that St. <i>Cyprian</i>
wrote the famous Letter to <i>Jubaianus</i>, who was a Bishop; but
in what Province, or of what City, we know not. <i>Jubaianus</i> had,
by a Letter, asked St. <i>Cyprian</i>’s Opinion about the Baptizing of Heretics;
and, at the same time, sent him the Copy of a Letter, which
he had received; wherein many Reasons were alleged to prove, that
Baptism, by whomsoever administred, not even the <i>Marcionites</i> excepted,
ought to be deemed valid. The Author of this Letter inveighs
bitterly against St. <i>Cyprian</i>, and those of his Party, styling
them Betrayers of the Truth, and Enemies to the Peace and Unity of
the Church<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c015'><sup>[434]</sup></a>. <i>Baronius</i>, and likewise <i>Pamelius</i>, ascribe that Piece
to <i>Stephen</i>, not apprised that they must consequently own the Doctrine
held by <i>Stephen</i> to have been no less erroneous than that
which was held by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, if the Doctrine of the Church be
true, as I have observed above. But we have not sufficient Grounds
to suppose <i>Stephen</i> the Author of it, since many besides him writ
in favour of that Opinion. St. <i>Cyprian</i>, in Answer to <i><a id='corr67.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Jubaianns'>Jubaianus</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_67.25'><ins class='correction' title='Jubaianns'>Jubaianus</ins></a></span></i>,
sent him his Letter to <i>Quintus</i>, that of the first Council to the Bishops
of <i>Numidia</i>; and, moreover, wrote him a long Letter, with a great
many Arguments in favour of his Opinion, and the Answers to what
was objected against it; especially in the Letter, whereof <i>Jubaianus</i>
had transmitted him a Copy<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c015'><sup>[435]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Desire to<br/>live in Peace and<br/>Unity with those who<br/>held the opposite<br/>Opinion.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He ends his Letter by a most solemn
Protestation of Unity and Charity with those who should differ from
him; which is related at Length by St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c015'><sup>[436]</sup></a>, and likewise by St.
<i>Austin</i>, who tells us, that he was never tired with reading over and
over again those Words of Peace and Charity, breathing nothing
but the sweetest Odour of that Union, in which the holy Prelate
anxiously sought to live with his Brethren<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c015'><sup>[437]</sup></a>. To this Letter <i>Jubaianus</i>
returned Answer, that he had fully convinced him, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>he willingly embraced his Opinion<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c015'><sup>[438]</sup></a>. In that Letter St. <i>Cyprian</i>
seems to have mustered all the Arguments that could be alleged in
favour of his Opinion; and therefore St. <i>Austin</i> has employed his
Third, Fourth, and Fifth Books on Baptism, in confuting them.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have hitherto seen with how much Temper, Moderation, and
Candor, the Dispute was managed on St. <i>Cyprian</i>’s Side: he determined
nothing without the Advice and Approbation of his Collegues
assembled in Council; the Determinations of the Council he imparted
to other Bishops, leaving them at full Liberty to embrace or reject
them, and declaring, that no Disagreement in Opinion should
occasion in him the least Breach of Charity. How different was the
Conduct of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>! <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Stephen<i>’s Pride<br/>and Arrogance</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He condescended, indeed, to answer
the synodal Letter of the <i>African</i> Bishops; but did it with that
Pride and Arrogance, that in After-ages became the Characteristic
of his Successors. He begins with the Dignity of his See, and his
pretended Succession to St. <i>Peter</i>, which he takes care to put them
in mind of: in the next Place, he rejects their Decrees with the utmost
Indignation, and attempts to confute the Arguments alleged to
support them: he then proceeds to Commands and Menaces, ordering
St. <i>Cyprian</i> to quit his Opinion, and threatening to cut off, from
the Communion of the Church, all those who should presume to
differ from him, and rebaptize Heretics: he concludes his Letter
with a bitter Invective against St. <i>Cyprian</i>, branding that great Luminary
of the Church with the reproachful Names of <i>false Christ</i>, <i>false
Apostle</i>, <i>deceitful Workman</i><a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c015'><sup>[439]</sup></a>. Such was Pope <i>Stephen</i>’s Answer to a
most respectful Letter from a Council of 71 Bishops. <i>Pompeius</i>, Bishop
of <i>Sabrata</i> in the <i>Tripolitana</i>, hearing of this Letter, and being
desirous to peruse it, as he had done all the rest on the same Subject,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is severely<br/>censured by St.</i><br/>Cyprian.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> St. <i>Cyprian</i>, in Compliance with his Desire, sent him a Copy
of it; and at the same time writ him a Letter, wherein he treats
<i>Stephen</i>, upon the just Provocation he had given him, with more
than ordinary Sharpness and Acrimony, charging him with <i>Pride and
Impertinence</i>, with <i>Self-contradiction and Ignorance</i>, with <i>Indiscretion</i>,
<i>Obstinacy</i>, <i>Childishness</i>; nay, he styles him a <i>Favourer and
Abetter of Heretics against the Church of God</i><a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c015'><sup>[440]</sup></a>. St. <i>Cyprian</i> was
more provoked at <i>Stephen</i>’s abusive Language, than moved either by
his Authority or Menaces. St. <i>Austin</i> supposes the Opinion he held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to have been false and erroneous; and yet owns, that he was not
obliged to yield to the Authority of <i>Stephen</i>, nor give up the Point,
till he was convinced by dint of Reason, or by the Decision of an
Oecumenical Council<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c015'><sup>[441]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St.</i> Cyprian<br/><i>assembles a great<br/>Council at</i> Carthage;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, as St. <i>Cyprian</i> sought nothing but
Truth, upon the Receipt of <i>Stephen</i>’s Letter, he summoned a great
Council, in order to have the Question canvassed anew, and examined
with more Care and Attention. The Council met accordingly, on
 the First of <i>September</i> 256. consisting of 85 Bishops, a great Number
of Presbyters and Deacons, and a considerable Part of the People<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c015'><sup>[442]</sup></a>.
To this Assembly were read the Letter of <i>Jubaianus</i> to St. <i>Cyprian</i>,
his Answer to it, and <i>Jubaianus</i>’s Reply; with the Letter of the
former Council to <i>Stephen</i>, and <i>Stephen</i>’s Answer to the Council.
These Pieces being read, St. <i>Cyprian</i> made a short Discourse, exhorting
his Collegues to speak their Mind freely: the Words he used
on this Occasion alluded, without Doubt, to the Pride and Arrogance
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>; <i>Let none of us</i>, says he, <i>set up for the Bishop
of Bishops; let none of us presume to reduce our Collegues by a
tyrannical Fear to the Necessity of obeying</i>: he concluded with protesting
anew, in the most solemn manner, that he left every one the
full Liberty of following what Opinion he liked best; and that no
Man should, on that score, be judged by him, or separated from his
Communion<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c015'><sup>[443]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which confirms the<br/>antient Practice</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Discourse being finished, each Bishop delivered
his Opinion, and St. <i>Cyprian</i> the last, all approving, with one Consent,
the Baptizing of Heretics. <i>Pamelius</i> and others count 87 Bishops
present at the Council, because <i>Natalis</i> of <i>Oea</i> spoke for the
Two other Bishops of <i>Libya Tripolitana</i>, viz. <i>Pompeius</i> of <i>Sabrata</i>,
and <i>Dioga</i> of <i>Leptis the Great</i><a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c015'><sup>[444]</sup></a>, who were absent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Third Council of <i>Carthage</i> having thus confirmed the
Decrees of the Two former, notwithstanding the Threats and Menaces
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, it was thought adviseable for the Peace of
the Church to acquaint him therewith; and at the same time to
inform him more particularly of the Reasons, on which their Opinion
was grounded. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Deputies sent<br/>to</i> Stephen, <i>how<br/>treated</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Deputies were accordingly dispatched to <i>Rome</i>
for that Purpose; but <i>Stephen</i> not only refused to see or hear them,
but would not allow any of his Flock to correspond with them, to
supply them with the Necessaries of Life, or even to admit them under
the same Roof; excluding them not only from his Communion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>but from common Hospitality, says, <i>Firmilian</i>, who wrote this very
Year<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c015'><sup>[445]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He excommunicates<br/>all who held the<br/>opposite Opinion.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He did not stop here; but, transported with Rage, or Zeal,
as <i>Baronius</i> is pleased to style it, he cut off from his Communion all
the Bishops who had assisted at the Council, and all those who held
the same Opinion, that is, the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, <i>Numidia</i>, <i>Mauritania</i>,
<i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Galatia</i>, and <i>Egypt</i><a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c015'><sup>[446]</sup></a>. But <i>Stephen</i>’s
Anathemas proved, as those of <i>Victor</i>’s had done before, <i>bruta fulmina</i>;
no Regard was had to them, no, not even by those of his
own Party; who, by continuing in Communion with those whom
he had cut off from his, sufficiently declared their Thoughts touching
his rash and unchristian Conduct. This Dispute, says St. <i>Austin</i>, occasioned
no Schism in the Church, the Bishops continuing united in
Charity, notwithstanding their Disagreement in Opinion<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c015'><sup>[447]</sup></a>. No Thanks
to <i>Stephen</i>, who did all that lay in his Power to set the Bishops at
Variance, and involve the whole Church in Confusion and Disorder:
<i>The Peace of Christ</i>, continues St. <i>Austin</i>, <i>triumphed in their Hearts,
and put a Stop to the growing Schism</i>; not in the Heart of <i>Stephen</i>,
where Rage, Ambition, and Envy lodged; Guests incompatible with
Peace and Charity; but in the Hearts of the other Bishops, who were
thereby restrained from following his Example. How many Schisms
had been prevented, had Bishops in After-ages trod in the Footsteps
of those great Prelates!</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stephen’<i>s Conduct<br/>disapproved by</i><br/>Dionysius <i>of</i><br/>Alexandria;</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Dionysius</i>, afterwards Pope, and <i>Philemon</i>, both then Presbyters of
the Church of <i>Rome</i>, acquainted, no doubt, by <i>Stephen</i>’s Direction,
the great <i>Dionysius</i>, Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, with what had passed,
hoping to gain him over to their Party, and extort from him an Approbation
of <i>Stephen</i>’s Conduct: but that illustrious Prelate, foreseeing,
and well weighing, the evil Consequences that might attend it,
declared his Sentiments with all the Freedom and Zeal that became
a Man of his Rank in the Church. He told them plainly, that the
condemning a Practice, which had been established by so many Councils,
was what he could by no means approve of; that an Affair of
such Consequence required long and mature Deliberation; and that
the deciding it over-hastily might raise eternal Disputes, and end at
last in a Schism: he therefore begged <i>Stephen</i>, in a Letter, which he
writ to him on this Occasion, that he would, upon Reflection, alter
his Conduct; and in an Affair upon which so much depended, take
different Measures from those which he had hitherto pursued<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c015'><sup>[448]</sup></a>. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><i>Stephen</i> wrote to <i>Dionysius</i>, so did St. <i>Cyprian</i> to <i>Firmilian</i>, giving
him a particular and candid Account both of <i>Stephen</i>’s Conduct and
his own. <i>Firmilian</i> was Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i> in <i>Cappadocia</i>, and one
of the most eminent Prelates at that Time in the Church both for Piety
and Learning: he had a singular Veneration for St. <i>Cyprian</i>, maintained
with great Zeal the same Cause, and consequently had been
equally ill used and excommunicated by <i>Stephen</i>. He therefore
received with extraordinary Joy the Letter, which St. <i>Cyprian</i> sent him
by <i>Rogatian</i> one of his Deacons, often read it with great Satisfaction<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c015'><sup>[449]</sup></a>,
and answered it with a long Letter<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c015'><sup>[450]</sup></a>, which is still extant, though
St. <i>Cyprian</i>’s to him has been lost long since. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and severely censured<br/>by</i> Firmilian.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In this Letter <i>Firmilian</i>,
amazed and provoked at <i>Stephen</i>’s unaccountable Conduct, expresses
his Detestation of it in sharper Terms than the Laws of Charity can
well allow; for, not content to charge him with sacrificing the Peace
of the Church to a petulant Humour, he compares him to <i>Judas</i>, and
stigmatizes him with the Epithets of inhuman, audacious, insolent,
wicked, impious Schismatic; for <i>he is a true Schismatic</i>, says <i>Firmilian,
who departs from the Unity of the Church, which thou hast
done, O</i> Stephen; <i>for, by attempting to separate others from thee,

hast thou heaped upon thyself by cutting thyself off from so many
Flocks<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c015'><sup>[451]</sup></a>!</i> <i>Firmilian</i>’s Letter was translated into <i>Latin</i> by St. <i>Cyprian</i>
himself, as is manifest from the Style. It was unknown, it seems, to
St. <i>Austin</i>; for he never quotes it, nor, in confuting the Opinion of
Sr. <i>Cyprian</i>, takes any notice of some Reasons alleged in that Letter
to support it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stephen <i>dies, but not<br/>a Martyr</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>There was no Hope of seeing an End put to this Dispute, so long as
<i>Stephen</i> lived; but he dying, his Successor, who was a Man of a quite
different Temper, laid the Storm, which his furious and ungovernable
Passion had raised. He died on the 2d of <i>August</i> 257. according to
the most probable Opinion<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c015'><sup>[452]</sup></a>. The Church of <i>Rome</i>, upon the Authority
of his Acts, ranks him among the Martyrs; but that Honour
is not paid him either by St. <i>Austin</i>, or by <i>Vincentius Lirinensis</i>, who,
naming him together with St. <i>Cyprian</i>, as they often do, give constantly
the Title of Martyr to the latter, and never to the former. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Acts fabulous.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As
for his Acts, they flatly contradict, in several Points, the most unexceptionable
Writers among the Antients<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c015'><sup>[453]</sup></a>, and therefore by no means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>deserve the Credit which <i>Baronius</i> would have us give them<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c015'><sup>[454]</sup></a>. Even
<i>Anastasius</i> seems to have made no Account of them, if in his Time
they were yet composed, which may be questioned; for the Account
he gives us of <i>Stephen</i>’s Death differs widely from that which we read
in those Acts<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c015'><sup>[455]</sup></a>. But he had made a bold Attempt towards extending
the Power and Authority of the See of <i>Rome</i>, and therefore was to
be placed among the Saints for the Encouragement of others. To
say he had merited that Honour by his Virtues, either as a Christian or
a Bishop, had been carrying the Imposture too far: the only Means
therefore left of making him a Saint, was to make him a Martyr, that,
by his glorious Death, he might be thought to have deserved what it
was manifest from the Records of those Times he had not deserved by
his Christian Life. Hence Acts were forged, setting forth his heroic
Confession of the Faith before the Emperor, his Sufferings on that
Account, the stupendous Miracles he wrought, <i>&amp;c.</i> which, however
incredible, might, in Process of Time, by their Antiquity alone, gain
Credit with the greater Part of Mankind. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Reliques.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Stephen</i> was buried in the
C&oelig;metery of <i>Callistus</i><a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c015'><sup>[456]</sup></a>; whence his Body was translated about the
Year 762. by <i>Paul</i> I. to a Monastery of <i>Greek</i> Monks, which that
Pope had built in <i>Rome</i>, as we read in <i>Anastasius</i><a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c015'><sup>[457]</sup></a>. How it got from
thence to <i>Trani</i> in <i>Apulia</i> nobody knows; but from that City it was
conveyed with great Pomp in 1682. to <i>Pisa</i> in <i>Tuscany</i>, where it is
still worshiped in a Church bearing the pretended Saint’s Name<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c015'><sup>[458]</sup></a>.
According to the most probable Opinion, <i>Stephen</i> governed Four Years,
and about Six Months.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Stephen</i> being dead, <i>Sixtus</i> or <i>Xystus</i> II. a Deacon of the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, was chosen to succeed him. As the late Dispute
was not yet ended, <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i> no sooner heard
of his Promotion, than he began to press him with great Earnestness to
relinquish the wild Pretensions of his Predecessor, and concur with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the other Bishops in restoring Peace and Tranquillity to the Church<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c015'><sup>[459]</sup></a>.
He writ Three Letters to him on the same Subject, whereof the
last was from <i>Dionysius</i> and the whole Church of <i>Alexandria</i>, to
<i>Sixtus</i> and the whole Church of <i>Rome</i><a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c015'><sup>[460]</sup></a>. He writ likewise to <i>Dionysius</i>
and <i>Philemon</i>, two Presbyters of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, whom
we have mentioned above, and who upon <i>Stephen</i>’s Death seem to
have abandoned his Party; for <i>Dionysius</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, in his first
Letter to <i>Sixtus</i>, writes, That these two Presbyters had been formerly
of <i>Stephen</i>’s Opinion<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c015'><sup>[461]</sup></a>, a plain Indication that they were not then.
The Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i> had at last the Satisfaction to see his pious
Endeavours crowned with Success; for we find no farther Mention
of this Dispute till it was revived by the <i>Donatists</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Peace restored to<br/>the Church by his<br/>means.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In what
manner it ended, we are no-where told; but it is manifest from the
Writers of those Times, that the <i>African</i> and <i>Asiatic</i> Bishops continued
the same Practice of baptizing Heretics, till it was condemned
by the two great Councils, of <i>Arles</i> in 314. and of <i>Nice</i> in 325<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c015'><sup>[462]</sup></a>.
Whence we may well conclude, that the Terms proposed at the Beginning
of the Dispute by <i>Dionysius</i> and St. <i>Cyprian</i> were agreed to
by <i>Sixtus</i>, <i>viz.</i> That no Restraint should be laid on the Bishops of
either Side, but that every one should be allowed to follow undisturbed
which of the two Opinions he thought most agreeable to the Scripture
and to Reason. This was allowing the Bishops to consult the
Scriptures, and make use of their own Reason, in a Point already
judged and decided by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. But the Successors of
<i>Sixtus</i> have not been so complaisant; for they pretend, that a blind
Faith ought to be yielded to all their Decisions as infallibly true, a
blind Obedience to all their Decrees as unquestionably holy.</p>

<p class='c001'>But now the Persecution, which had begun some Months before the
Decease of <i>Stephen</i>, raged with more Violence than ever: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Valerian <i>persecutes<br/>the Church</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For <i>Valerian</i>
having, at the Instigation of an <i>Egyptian</i> Magician, changed the
Kindness he once had for the Christians into an implacable Hatred, he
ordered, by a Rescript to the Senate, all Bishops, Priests, and Deacons,
to be carefully sought for, and executed without Mercy<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c015'><sup>[463]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sixtus <i>martyred</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Pursuant
to this Order, <i>Sixtus</i>, who among the first fell into the Hands of the
Persecutors, was immediately either beheaded, as we read in the Pontifical
of <i>Bucherius</i><a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c015'><sup>[464]</sup></a>, or crucified, as we are told by <i>Prudentius</i><a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c015'><sup>[465]</sup></a>;

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Sixtus</i> being dead, and the Christians prevented by the Persecution
from assembling to chuse another in his room, the See remained
vacant almost a whole Year, that is, from the 6th of <i>August</i> 258. to
the 22d of <i>July</i> 259. when <i>Dionysius</i>, a Presbyter of the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, whom we have mentioned above, was elected, to the great
Satisfaction of the Faithful; for he was one of the most eminent Men
of his Time both for Piety and Learning<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c015'><sup>[467]</sup></a>. During his Pontificate,
the <i>Goths</i> broke into the Empire, over-ran all <i>Asia Minor</i>, and, having
almost utterly destroyed the City of <i>Cæsarea</i>, they carried with them
into Captivity most of its Christian Inhabitants. <i>Firmilian</i> was then
Bishop of the Place, who had censured the Conduct of <i>Stephen</i> with
so much Sharpness and Acrimony; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Dionysius<i>’s Charity to<br/>the distressed Chris-<br/>tians of</i> Cæsarea.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> but the Remembrance of what
had passed on that unhappy Occasion had not that Effect on <i>Dionysius</i>,
which far less Provocations have had on many of his Successors; for
he no sooner heard of the Distress that Church was in, than, laying
hold of so favourable an Opportunity to exert his Charity, he writ a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Letter to comfort them in their Calamity, and at the same time
dispatched proper Persons with large Collections to ransom the Christians
who had fallen into the Hands of the <i>Barbarians</i><a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c015'><sup>[468]</sup></a>. The Letter,
which <i>Dionysius</i> wrote on this Occasion, was carefully kept in the
Archives of the Church of <i>Cæsarea</i>, as an authentic Monument of
his Goodness and Charity<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c015'><sup>[469]</sup></a>. The great <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>
having, at this Time, composed a learned Treatise to prove
against <i>Sabellius</i> the Distinction of the Divine Persons, some over-zealous
Catholics, misconstruing several Passages in that Work, and
concluding that he had run into the opposite Error, accused him to
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, as if he denied the Son to be consubstantial with
the Father<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c015'><sup>[470]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Dionysius <i>of</i> Alex-<br/>andria, <i>accused at</i><br/>Rome <i>over him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Hereupon the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, having assembled a
Council, acquainted <i>Dionysius</i> with the Sentiments of the other
Bishops, and his own, expressing his Concern, that the Divinity of
the Word should have been questioned by him, and at the same time
desiring him to answer the Accusation<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c015'><sup>[471]</sup></a>. This <i>Dionysius</i> readily did
in Four Books, which he styled <i>Confutation and Apology</i>; shewing
therein that his Opinion was very different from what it had been represented
at <i>Rome</i>, and explaining those Passages which had given Ground
for the Accusation. This Work he addressed to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i><a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c015'><sup>[472]</sup></a>.
Here <i>Baronius</i> exults. Behold, says he, one of the most eminent
Prelates of the Church, upon Suspicion of Heresy, arraigned at <i>Rome</i>,
judged at <i>Rome</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>That argues no<br/>Jurisdiction in the<br/>Bishop of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Who does not see a supreme Tribunal erected there,
to which all Causes must be brought; a sovereign Judge residing there,
by whom all Persons must be absolved or condemned; is either blind
and cannot see, or shuts his Eyes and will not see<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c015'><sup>[473]</sup></a>. And does not
the sharp-sighted Annalist himself see what every one the least conversant
in Ecclesiastical History must see, if he is not either blind and
cannot, or shuts his Eyes and will not see, <i>viz.</i> Bishops, when guilty,
or only suspected of Heresy, accused to some of their Collegues,
who neither had nor claimed any Jurisdiction over them? Thus was
the famous <i>Paul</i> of <i>Samosata</i>, Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, at this very Time,
accused by his whole Church, first to <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>,
and soon after to <i>Firmilian</i> Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i><a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c015'><sup>[474]</sup></a>. That such an Accusation
argued any Jurisdiction in those Bishops over the Bishop of
<i>Antioch</i>, is what <i>Baronius</i> himself dares not affirm; and yet a like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Accusation brought to <i>Rome</i> is enough for him to transform that See
into a supreme Tribunal; that Bishop, though far from such ambitious
Thoughts, into a sovereign Judge.  But the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, says
<i>Baronius</i>, required of <i>Dionysius</i> a Confession or Declaration of his
Faith: And does not that argue Superiority and Jurisdiction? <i>Baronius</i>
himself knew it does not: for it is impossible he should not know,
that when a Bishop was suspected of Heresy, all his Collegues had a
Right to require of him Confession of his Faith, and not to communicate
with him till they had received it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Paul <i>Bishop of</i><br/>Antioch <i>condemned<br/>and deposed</i>,</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Time of <i>Dionysius</i> was held the famous Council of <i>Antioch</i>,
which condemned and deposed <i>Paul</i> Bishop of that City, who denied
the Distinction of the Divine Persons, and the Divinity of <i>Christ</i>.
Of the Deposition of <i>Paul</i>, and the Election of <i>Damnus</i>, who was
placed in his room, Notice was immediately given to the whole
Church, by a Synodal Letter addressed to <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>,
and to <i>Maximus</i>, who had succeeded the great <i>Dionysius</i> in the See
of <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c015'><sup>[475]</sup></a>. And here it will not be foreign to my Purpose to
observe, that the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> was summoned to appear before
the Council, and not at the supreme Tribunal erected by <i>Baronius</i> at
<i>Rome</i>; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>without the Consent<br/>or Knowlege of the<br/>Bishop of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  that he was condemned and deposed without the consent or
Concurrence, nay, and without the Knowlege of the sovereign Judge
residing at <i>Rome</i>; that he did not appeal to him, which he certainly
would have done, as he was a Man of unparalleled Impudence and
Ambition, had such a Custom obtained in those Days; and lastly, that
the Fathers of the Council writ to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> in the same
Manner as they did to other Bishops, letting him know, that for the
future he was to communicate with <i>Damnus</i>, and not with <i>Paul</i>. All
this is manifest from the Account which St. <i>Basil</i> gives us of that
Council<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c015'><sup>[476]</sup></a>. And yet <i>Baronius</i> brings in that Father, even on this Occasion,
as an Evidence for the Papal Supremacy<a id='rN9' /><a href='#fN9' class='c015'><sup>[N9]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN9'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN9'>N9</a>. For by wrong pointing a Passage
in the <i>Latin</i> Translation of that Author,
he makes him contradict himself, and
ascribe the deposing of <i>Paul</i> to <i>Dionysius</i>
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and the Great <i>Dionysius</i>
Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, though the latter
was dead before <i>Paul</i> was deposed, as is
evident from the Letter which was written
by the Council on that Occasion, and is
addressed to <i>Maximus</i> the Successor of <i>Dionysius</i>
in the See of <i>Alexandria</i><a id='rN9.1' /><a href='#fN9.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The
Passage runs thus; <i>Duo enim</i> Dionysii <i>diu
ante eos septuaginta fuere, qui</i> Samosatensem
<i>sustulere, quorum alter</i> Romæ, <i>alter</i>
Alexandriæ <i>Præsul erat</i><a id='rN9.2' /><a href='#fN9.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The Meaning
of St. <i>Basil</i> is, that the two <i>Dionysius’s</i>
flourished before the Council of <i>Antioch</i>,
which consisted of Seventy Bishops, and deposed
<i>Paul</i> of <i>Samosata</i>; that is, before
the Second Council that was assembled
against him; for another had been convened
in the same City about eight Years
before to depose him; but upon his pretending
to renounce his Errors, the Sentence
had been suspended. The above-quoted
Passage <i>Baronius</i> stops thus; <i>Duo
enim</i> Dionysii <i>diu ante eos septuaginta
fuere; qui</i> Samosatensem <i>deposuere</i>, &amp;c.
so that the Relative <i>qui</i> refers, according to
this Method of Pointing, to the Two <i>Dionysius’s</i>,
and not to the Seventy Bishops: as
if St. <i>Basil</i> had said, <i>The Two</i> Dionysius<i>’s,
who deposed</i> Paul <i>of</i> Samosata, <i>flourished
before the Council of</i> Antioch, <i>which was
composed of Seventy Bishops</i><a id='rN9.3' /><a href='#fN9.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. So that
<i>Paul</i> must be twice deposed, St. <i>Basil</i> must
contradict himself, all the Writers of those
Times must be arraigned as guilty of an
unpardonable Omission, lest the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i> should appear to have been, what he
really was, an idle Spectator of a Transaction
so famous in the History of the
Church. A Writer of any Honour or Honesty
had rather give up a Cause, than expose
himself thus by attempting to defend
it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>From St. <i>Basil</i>, <i>Baronius</i> runs to the Emperor <i>Aurelian</i>, begging
of a Pagan Prince what he could not extort from a Catholic Bishop,
a Declaration and Acknowlegement of the Pope’s Supremacy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Paul <i>keeps Possession<br/>of the Bishop’s<br/>Habitation</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
Reader must know, that <i>Paul</i> having kept, by Force, Possession of the
Bishop’s Habitation in Defiance of the Council, the Catholic Bishops
had recourse to the Emperor, who, after hearing both Parties with
great Attention, adjudged the House to him, who should be acknowleged
by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and the other Bishops of <i>Italy</i><a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c015'><sup>[477]</sup></a>. This
<i>Baronius</i> interprets as an open Acknowlegement of the Pope’s Supremacy;
and that his Readers may not overlook it, as most of them
would be apt to do, he takes care to bespeak their Attention, by
marking it in the Margin with the following Words in Capitals, <i>The
Emperor</i> Aurelian <i>acknowleges the Supremacy of the Church of</i>
Rome<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c015'><sup>[478]</sup></a>. From this one would expect to find <i>Aurelian</i> not only
turned Christian, but prostrate at his Holiness’s Feet, and bowing
down to kiss them: but our Annalist, to the great Disappointment of
his Readers, after having thus raised their Attention, only repeats out
of <i>Eusebius</i> the Sentence pronounced by the Emperor, which he
would have us suppose with him to have been owing to the Knowlege
that Prince had of the Pope’s Supremacy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Emperor’s Sen-<br/>tence whether favour-<br/>able to the Pretensions<br/>of the See of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> And why must the Pope’s

of <i>Ravenna</i>, of <i>Milan</i>, of <i>Aquileia</i>, &amp;c. and, above all, the Supremacy
of the collective Body of the <i>Italian</i> Bishops? for to them, and not
to any particular Bishop, the Cause was referred by the Emperor. As
for the Emperor’s Conduct on this Occasion, it may be thus accounted
for: That just and wise Prince observed the Bishops in the East greatly
animated against <i>Paul</i>; and therefore apprehending them more sway’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>by Passion and Prejudice than by Justice and Equity, he referred the
Cause to the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, who, he thought, would judge more
impartially, as being placed at a Distance, and not engaged, at least
not so warmly, in the Dispute<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c015'><sup>[479]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Dionysius <i>dies</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But this happened Two Years after

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Marcellinus</i> succeeded <i>Caius</i> on the 30th of <i>June</i> 296.
and governed Eight Years, Three Months, and Twenty-five Days,
according to the most antient Records<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c015'><sup>[493]</sup></a>: so that he must have died on
the 24th of <i>October</i> 304. The Love of Truth, which an Historian
ought never to swerve from, obliges me to undertake the Defence of
this Pope against the Church of <i>Rome</i> herself, and most of her Divines,
who, joining the <i>Donatists</i> of <i>Africa</i>, have endeavoured to blacken
his Memory with Aspersions equally wicked and groundless. For the
Church of <i>Rome</i> tells us, both in her Breviary and Martyrology, and
her Divines must chime in with her, that <i>Marcellinus</i> being apprehended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>during the Persecution of <i>Dioclesian</i>, he was persuaded by
that Prince to deliver up the Holy Scripture to be burnt by the Pagans,
agreeably to a late Edict, and at the same time to offer Incense to the
Gods. This they found on the Acts of the Council of <i>Sinuessa</i>,
which is supposed to have been summoned on that Occasion, and before
which <i>Marcellinus</i> is said to have been convicted by Seventy-two
Witnesses of the above-mentioned Crimes. That such a scandalous
Story, invented by the <i>Donatists</i> of <i>Africa</i>, as St. <i>Austin</i> affirms<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c015'><sup>[494]</sup></a>,
should not only have been credited, but industriously propagated, by
the Successors of <i>Marcellinus</i>, must seem very strange and surprising
to those, who recollect with how much Zeal they have strove on other
Occasions to conceal or excuse the least Imperfections in their Predecessors.
If therefore they not only readily own the Apostasy of
<i>Marcellinus</i>, but are the first to divulge it, and take care to make it
known in the Breviary to those who scarce know any thing else, we
may be well assured there is a Snake hid in the Grass; the more as it
is certain almost beyond doubt, that no such Council was ever held;
and consequently that the Acts upon which alone that Apostasy is
founded, are supposititious. To unravel the Whole, the Reader must
know, that the Fall of <i>Marcellinus</i> made such a Noise in the Church,
as we read in those Acts, that immediately a grand Council met, composed
of no fewer than 300 Bishops. Before this Council <i>Marcellinus</i>
appeared; but, at his first Appearance, the Bishops, struck with Horror
at the very Thought of judging the Head of the Church, the Judge of
all, cried out with one Voice, <i>The first See is to be judged by nobody:
accuse yourself, judge yourself, condemn yourself</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their View, therein.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To this Testimony,
so favourable to the ambitious Views of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, is intirely
owing the Sanction which they have given to such Fables, highly
injurious to the Memory of one of their best Predecessors. Without
this Lenitive the Acts of the pretended Council of <i>Sinuessa</i>, supposing
the Apostasy of a Pope, had been condemned; the Absurdities and
Contradictions, which it is wholly made up of, had been set forth in a
proper Light; and the Testimonies of <i>Theodoret</i> and St. <i>Austin</i> had
been alleged to vindicate the Character of <i>Marcellinus</i>: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Marcellinus <i>com-<br/>mended and vindicated<br/>by the Antients</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> for of these two
Writers the former tells us, that he acquired great Glory by his Conduct
during the Persecution<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c015'><sup>[495]</sup></a>; and the latter, in writing against <i>Petilian</i>
the <i>Donatist</i>, has the following Words: <i>Why should I answer
the Calumnies with which he loads the Bishops of</i> Rome? <i>Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>should I clear them from the Crimes which he lays to their Charge?</i>
Marcellinus, <i>and his Presbyters</i> Melchiades, Marcellus, <i>and</i> Sylvester,
<i>are accused by him as if they had delivered up the sacred Books, and
offered Incense to the Gods: Are they therefore to be thought guilty?
Does he prove what he advances against them? He brands them
with the Epithets of wicked, and sacrilegious; but I say they are
innocent: And why should I produce Reasons to support my Defence,
since he brings none to make good his Charge<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c015'><sup>[496]</sup></a>?</i> But a solemn Declaration,
that <i>the See of</i> Rome <i>is to be judged by nobody</i>, made in
those early Times, by 300 Bishops, carries with it such Marks of
Truth, as quite invalidate the Testimonies of <i>Theodoret</i> and St. <i>Austin</i>,
and render the Apostasy of <i>Marcellinus</i>, which gave room to that
Declaration, undeniable! St. <i>Austin</i> looks upon the Apostasy of <i>Marcellinus</i>,
and his Presbyters <i>Melchiades</i>, <i>Marcellus</i>, and <i>Sylvester</i>, who
were all afterwards Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, as a mere Calumny, as an Invention
of the <i>Donatists</i>; but their Successors, trampling upon all Authority
that stands in the Way of their Ambition, chuse rather to have
Four of their Predecessors thought Apostates and Idolaters, than part
with the Decree of that pretended Council, exalting them so high
above all other Bishops.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Acts of the<br/>Council of</i><br/>Sinuessa <i>fabulous</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>If <i>Marcellinus</i> acquired great Glory during the Persecution, as
<i>Theodoret</i> assures us; if his Apostasy was a mere Calumny, broached
by the <i>Donatists</i>, as we read in St. <i>Austin</i>; the pretended Council of
<i>Sinuessa</i> must be given up, since it is supposed to have been assembled
on occasion of <i>Marcellinus</i>’s Fall: but, abstracting from the Fall of
<i>Marcellinus</i>, the Circumstances attending that Council are in themselves
so absurd and incredible, that there needs no other Argument
to convince a Man, who has any Understanding, and dares to use it,
that no such Council ever was, or could be held. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>No such Council<br/>ever held.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For who can conceive
it possible, that, during the most cruel Persecution the Church
ever suffered, 300 Bishops should assemble, not in <i>Rome</i>, where they
might more easily have met unobserved, but in a small Country
Town, where a much less numerous Assembly must immediately have
been observed and suspected? But, after the Death of <i>Fabianus</i>, says
<i>Baronius</i><a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c015'><sup>[497]</sup></a>, the Clergy of <i>Rome</i>, and the Bishops, met to chuse him
a Successor, notwithstanding the Persecution that raged then. He
ought to have said <i>some Bishops</i>, as St. <i>Cyprian</i> does<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c015'><sup>[498]</sup></a>, whom he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>quotes; but I shall say so for him, that his Argument may appear in
its full Strength, and save me the Trouble of answering it; for it
will then run thus: Some Bishops, perhaps 15 or 20, met unobserved
in the great and populous City of <i>Rome</i>: <i>Ergo</i>, 300 might meet
unobserved in a small Country Town; for such was <i>Sinuessa</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The many Absurdities<br/>contained in the Acts<br/>of that Council.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This Council is supposed to have been held in a Grotto, or
Cave, where there was no room but for 50 at a time; and yet they
are all said to have been present when <i>Marcellinus</i> owned his Crime,
and divested himself of his Dignity. And what a despicable Figure
does he make on that Occasion! At first he denies the Charge; but,
being convicted by 72 Eye-witnesses, he owns it at last, but in Terms
more becoming a School-boy, trembling at the Sight of a Rod, than
a penitent Bishop, before so grave an Assembly. But the most remarkable
Passage in that Piece is the Dispute between <i>Urbanus</i> High Pontiff
of <i>Jupiter</i>, and <i>Marcellinus</i> High Pontiff of the Christians. <i>Urbanus</i>,
to convince his Fellow-Pontiff that he ought not to scruple
offering Incense to <i>Jupiter</i>, alleges the Example of the Mages offering
Incense to <i>Christ</i>. <i>Marcellinus</i> answers, That the offering of Incense
on that Occasion was mysterious; and unravels the Mystery.
Hereupon <i>Urbanus</i>, unacquainted with Mysteries, appeals to the Judgment
of the Emperors <i>Dioclesian</i> and <i>Maximian</i>; to this Appeal
<i>Marcellinus</i> agrees; and the Controversy is referred by both <i>Pontiffs</i>
to be decided by the Two Emperors. They, no doubt, gave Sentence
in favour of <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Urbanus</i>; and then <i>Dioclesian</i>, taking
<i>Marcellinus</i> with him into the Temple of <i>Vesta</i>, persuaded him there
to offer Incense to <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Hercules</i>, and <i>Saturn</i>. How these Three
Deities came to have a Place in the Temple of <i>Vesta</i>, the Compiler
of these Acts alone knows. Such are the Absurdities and Contradictions,
of which that Piece is wholly made up. But it flatters the
Ambition of the Successors of <i>Marcellinus</i>; on occasion of his Fall
it exalts the See of <i>Rome</i> above all other Sees: its Authority therefore
must not be called in question: all the Absurdities and Contradictions
it contains, must be blindly believed; the Memory of
<i>Marcellinus</i> most unjustly slandered; the Testimonies of <i>Theodoret</i>,
and St. <i>Austin</i>, clearing him from all Guilt, disregarded and rejected.
And may not this be interpreted as a tacit Declaration, that they had
rather he had been guilty than innocent, provided his Guilt could
any-ways contribute to the Aggrandizing of their See? What can we
think their Ambition will spare, since they have thus sacrificed to it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the Character of one of their Predecessors, whose Memory is revered
by all Antiquity? The Church of <i>Rome</i> honours <i>Marcellinus</i> as a
Saint; and, not withstanding his pretended Apostasy, allows him a
Place amongst her Martyrs; probably by way of Reparation for the
Injustice done him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Marcellinus <i>falsly<br/>supposed to have died<br/>a Martyr</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But his Martyrdom may be justly questioned; at
least it seems to have been utterly unknown to St. <i>Austin</i>, who flourished
not long after his Time, since he never mentions it, tho’ it
would have afforded him the strongest Argument he could possibly use
to silence the <i>Donatists</i>. His Martyrdom, 'tis true, is vouched by
<i>Bede</i>, who tells us, that he was beheaded at <i>Rome</i>, by <i>Dioclesian</i>’s
Order; but that Historian is often led into gross Mistakes by a Pontifical,
supposed to have been written in the Sixth Century, which he
frequently copies, with all its Anachronisms, and other Faults.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Vacancy of<br/>Three Years.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>That, upon the Death of <i>Marcellinus</i>, there happened a Vacancy
of some Years, seems undeniable, since it is marked in the Pontificals,
even in that of <i>Bucherius</i><a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c015'><sup>[499]</sup></a>, and mentioned by all those who, till
<i>Baronius</i>’s Time, have written the History of the Popes: but what at
this time should occasion a Vacancy at least of Three Years, is what
I will not take upon me to account for: the Persecution lasted but
Two Years in <i>Italy</i>, according to <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c015'><sup>[500]</sup></a>, which expired soon
after the Death of <i>Marcellinus</i>: some pretend that it raged there so
long as <i>Galerius</i> was Master of that Country. Be that as it will, it
is certain, that <i>Maxentius</i> usurped the Empire in 306. and that he
not only favoured the Christians, but pretended to be of the same
Religion himself; and yet the See remained vacant, according to the
Pontifical of <i>Bucherius</i><a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c015'><sup>[501]</sup></a>, till the Tenth Consulate of <i>Maximian Hercules</i>,
and the Seventh of <i>Maximian Galerius</i>, that is, till the Year
308. <i>Baronius</i> indeed admits of no Vacancy; but, in Opposition to
all those who have written before him, places the Election of <i>Marcellus</i>
immediately after the Decease of his Predecessor <i>Marcellinus</i><a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c015'><sup>[502]</sup></a>.
This I should readily agree to, but for the Authority of the above-mentioned
Pontifical, which had not yet appeared in <i>Baronius</i>’s
Time, and is thought to have been written about the Year 354. As
for the Chronicle of <i>Eusebius</i>, it can be here of no Weight on the
one Side or the other, since <i>Marcellus</i> is there quite left out; and his
Successor <i>Melchiades</i> is said to have died before <i>Constantine</i> made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>himself Master of <i>Rome</i>; whereas it is certain, that, under <i>Melchiades</i>,
a Council was held at <i>Rome</i>, by that Prince’s Order, as we shall see
hereafter.</p>

doubt, whether <i>Marcellus</i> was ever Bishop of <i>Rome</i><a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c015'><sup>[505]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but distinguished<br/>by others</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But <i>Marcellinus</i>
and <i>Marcellus</i> are evidently distinguished in the Pontifical of <i>Bucherius</i>,
by the different Times, in which they governed, and the different
Consuls, under whom their Government began and ended<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c015'><sup>[506]</sup></a>. They
are, besides, distinguished both by <i>Optatus Milevitanus</i><a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c015'><sup>[507]</sup></a>, and St.
<i>Austin</i><a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c015'><sup>[508]</sup></a>, who speaks of <i>Marcellus</i>, not only as a Presbyter of the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, but as Bishop of that See. To these Testimonies
I may add the Epitaph of <i>Marcellus</i> by Pope <i>Damasus</i>, supposing
him to have been Bishop of <i>Rome</i><a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c015'><sup>[509]</sup></a>. <i>Damasus</i> flourished about the
Year 366. Many things are said of <i>Marcellus</i>; but they are all
founded either on his Acts, or the modern Pontificals, and consequently
have no Foundation at all. Pope <i>Damasus</i>, in his Epitaph,
tells us, that his Steadiness in keeping up the Discipline of the Church,
and obliging such as had fallen, during the Persecution, to give due
Satisfaction, stirred up against him a general Hatred, which, not confined
to private Disputes and Invectives, ended in Tumults, Bloodshed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and Murders<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c015'><sup>[510]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Marcellus <i>is banished</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Damasus</i> adds, that <i>the Crime of one, who
had renounced the Faith, while the Church enjoyed a profound Peace,
induced the Tyrant</i> Maxentius <i>to send</i> Marcellus <i>into Banishment</i>. But
of these Transactions the Antients either have not thought fit to give
us a more particular Account, or, if they did, their Writings have
not reached our Times. <i>Marcellus</i> died on the 16th of <i>January</i> 310.
having held the Pontificate One Year, Seven Months, and Twenty
Days<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c015'><sup>[511]</sup></a>; but whether he died in Banishment, or was recalled to <i>Rome</i>,
is uncertain. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Acts are fabulous.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Church of <i>Rome</i>, upon the Authority of his fabulous
Acts, has added him, with many others, to the Number of her
Martyrs: but <i>Maxentius</i>, who reigned at <i>Rome</i> during his Pontificate,
and under whom he is said to have suffered, had no sooner
made himself Master of that City, than he put an End to the Persecution,
as we are told, in express Terms, by <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c015'><sup>[512]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Reliques.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He is said

worshiped in several Places; <i>viz.</i> in a Church, bearing his Name,
at <i>Rome</i>; in the Abbey of <i>Omont</i> in <i>Hainault</i>, not far from <i>Maubeuge</i>;

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Melchiades</i>, or <i>Miltiades</i>, as he is called in the antient
Manuscripts, was chosen to succeed <i>Eusebius</i>, on the 2d of <i>July</i>
311. after a Vacancy of Nine Months, and upwards
<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c015'><sup>[519]</sup></a>; which Historians
do not account for. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantine <i>con-<br/>verted to the Christ-<br/>ian Religion</i>.<br/><br/> <i>His Edicts in favour<br/>of the Christians.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In his Time happened the ever memorable
Conversion of <i>Constantine</i> to the Christian Religion. That Prince,
having overcome and utterly defeated the Usurper <i>Maxentius</i>, on
the 28th of <i>October</i> 312. soon after issued an Edict, jointly with <i>Licinius</i>,
who was upon the point of marrying his Sister, allowing the
Christians the free Exercise of their Religion, and likewise the Liberty
of building Churches<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c015'><sup>[520]</sup></a>. By the same Edict he ordered the Places,
where they had held their Assemblies before the Persecution, and
which had been taken from them, to be restored<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c015'><sup>[521]</sup></a>. He left <i>Rome</i> in
the Beginning of the Year 313. and, arriving at <i>Milan</i>, he there issued
a Second Edict, to correct some Mistakes that had given Offence in
the former<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c015'><sup>[522]</sup></a>. What these Mistakes were, we know not; for the Decree
itself has not reached our Times; but <i>Valesius</i> conjectures, that
the high Commendations bestowed on the Christian Religion alarmed
the Pagans, imagining, that the Intention of the Two Princes was
to suppress theirs; and likewise, that some Christians had taken Offence
at the odious Name of Heretics; given in that Decree to the
various Sects sprung from them<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c015'><sup>[523]</sup></a>. Be that as it will, it is certain,
that, by the Second Decree, an intire Liberty of Conscience was
granted to all sorts of Persons, every one being allowed to honour
and worship what Deity he pleased; and in what manner soever he
thought best. The Second Edict strictly injoins all those, who had
purchased of the Exchequer, or held by Grant, any Place formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>destined for the Assemblies of the Christians, to restore them forthwith,
and apply to the Exchequer; where they should be indemnified<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c015'><sup>[524]</sup></a>.
The same Year 313. <i>Licinius</i>, having gained a complete
Victory over <i>Maximinus</i>, a sworn Enemy to the Christians, made
himself Master of <i>Nicomedia</i>, and there caused the Edict of <i>Milan</i> to
be proclaimed, and set up in the Market-place, on the 13th of
<i>June</i><a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c015'><sup>[525]</sup></a>. Thus Peace was restored to the Church, in the East as well
as in the West, after a most cruel and bloody Persecution of Ten
Years, and almost Four Months; for the First Edict against the Christians
had been published in that very City on the 24th of <i>February</i>
303<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c015'><sup>[526]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Schism of the</i><br/>Donatists <i>in</i> Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'>Another remarkable Incident of this Pontificate was, the famous
Schism, formed in <i>Africa</i> against <i>Cæcilianus</i>, the Catholic Bishop
of <i>Carthage</i>; whereof a succinct Account will not be foreign to my
Subject, as <i>Melchiades</i> was chiefly concerned in most of the Transactions
relating to it. The first Decree against the Christians, published
by <i>Dioclesian</i>, which I have just now mentioned, ordered the
Churches to be every-where laid level with the Ground, the Books of
the Scripture to be carefully sought for, and publicly burnt; and that
such Persons of Quality as should persist in the Profession of the
Christian Faith, should be deemed infamous, and excluded from all
Honours and Employments. This Edict was executed with such Rigour
in <i>Africa</i>, that it was a capital Crime in the Magistrates of the
Cities, and punishable with Death, to shew any Mercy or Compassion
to a Christian, who, owning he had the sacred Books, should
refuse to deliver them into the Hands of the proper Officers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Traditores <i>who</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Those
who, in Compliance with this Edict, delivered them up, which great
Numbers did, were styled <i>Traditores</i>, a Name, which afterwards became
famous in the History of the Church, by affording the <i>Donatists</i>
a plausible Pretence to separate themselves from the Communion
of the Catholic Bishops<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c015'><sup>[527]</sup></a>. Of this Crime <i>Mensurius</i>, Bishop of
<i>Carthage</i>, was falsly accused; but, though the Charge could not be
proved against him, yet some of his Flock, encouraged by <i>Donatus</i>,
Bishop of <i>Casænigræ</i> in <i>Numidia</i>, separated from his Communion<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c015'><sup>[528]</sup></a>.
<i>Mensurius</i> dying some Years after, <i>Cæcilianus</i>, Deacon of the Church
of <i>Carthage</i>, was chosen in his room, in Spite of the Cabals and Intrigues
of <i>Botrus</i> and <i>Cælesius</i>, Two chief Presbyters, who aspired to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that Dignity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The chief Authors<br/>of the Schism<br/>against</i> Cæcilianus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Cæcilianus</i>, soon after his Election, summoned some
Persons, in whose Custody his Predecessor had left the Money of the
Church, to deliver it up to him: but they not only refused to comply
with his Demand, but began to stir up the People, and form
a Party against him. <i>Botrus</i> and <i>Cælesius</i> were not idle on this Occasion;
but, animated with Jealousy and Envy, lest no Art unpractised
to blacken his Character, and discredit him with those who had preferred
him to them. But the chief Support of this Faction was <i>Lucilla</i>,
a Woman of great Quality, Wealth, and Interest, and an avowed
Enemy to <i>Cæcilianus</i>, who, while he was yet Deacon, had publicly
reprimanded her for kissing the Relique of a Martyr, as she was upon
the Point of receiving the Eucharist. An undeniable Proof, that the
Worship of Reliques was at this time disapproved by the Church.
Such Liberty taken with a Person of her Rank, was what she could
not brook; and therefore she laid hold of the first Opportunity that
offered, and no better could offer, to revenge the Affront<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c015'><sup>[529]</sup></a>. It is
not to be doubted but those, who had separated from <i>Mensurius</i>,
joined this Faction; since the Second Schism owed its Origin to the
First, as St. <i>Austin</i> says, speaking of the Two Schisms under <i>Mensurius</i>
and <i>Cæcilianus</i><a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c015'><sup>[530]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Bishops of</i><br/>Numidia <i>summoned<br/>to depose him</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Schismatics, to give an Appearance of Justice and Authority
to their Proceedings, summoned <i>Secundus</i> Bishop of <i>Tigisis</i>, and the
other Bishops of <i>Numidia</i>, to depose <i>Cæcilianus</i>, and chuse another
in his room; for the Bishops of <i>Numidia</i> claimed the Privilege of
assisting at the Election of the Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, and ordaining
him after he was elected<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c015'><sup>[531]</sup></a>. They readily complied with the Summons;
but, upon their Arrival, they found, to their great Surprize,
that the whole City, except a small Number of Schismatics, the
avowed Enemies of <i>Cæcilianus</i>, communicated with him as their
lawful Bishop<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c015'><sup>[532]</sup></a>. They were 70 in Number; but as many of them
were <i>Traditors</i>, and some guilty of other enormous Crimes, as appears
from the Acts of the Council of <i>Cirtha</i><a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c015'><sup>[533]</sup></a>, they were easily prevailed
upon by <i>Lucilla</i>, who is said to have spent an immense Sum
on this Occasion<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c015'><sup>[534]</sup></a>, to declare the Election of <i>Cæcilianus</i> void, and the
See of <i>Carthage</i> vacant. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They declare his<br/>Election null.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The only thing they could lay to his Charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>was, that he had been ordained by <i>Felix</i> Bishop of <i>Aptungus</i>, whom
they falsly accused as a <i>Traditor</i>. <i>Cæcilianus</i> refused to Appear before
them; and truly to trust himself to such an Assembly, had been
acting a very imprudent Part; for <i>Purpurius</i>, Bishop of <i>Limata</i>, had
said, <i>If he comes among us, instead of laying our Hands upon him,
by way of Ordination, we ought to knock out his Brains, by way of
Penance</i><a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c015'><sup>[535]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Schismatics<br/>separate themselves<br/>from the Communion<br/>of the Church.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Party having thus declared <i>Cæcilianus</i> illegally elected and
ordained, they separated themselves from his Communion, and from
the Communion of all who communicated with him<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c015'><sup>[536]</sup></a>; that is, from
the Communion of the Catholic Church; for <i>Cæcilianus</i> was acknowleged
by the other Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and by
all the Bishops of the World, says St. <i>Austin</i><a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c015'><sup>[537]</sup></a>. Such was the Rise
of the famous Schism, which, for the Space of 300 Years, and upwards,
occasioned great Disturbances in the Churches of <i>Africa</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Called</i> Donatists,<br/><i>and from whom</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Donatus</i>,
Bishop of <i>Casænigræ</i> in <i>Numidia</i>, was the first Author of it,
according to St. <i>Austin</i><a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c015'><sup>[538]</sup></a>; but it was not from him, but from <i>Donatus</i>,
the Schismatic Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, that they took the Name of
<i>Donatists</i>; for, till his Time, they styled themselves the Party of
<i>Majorinus</i><a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c015'><sup>[539]</sup></a>, whom they chose and ordained Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, in
the room of <i>Cæcilianus</i>; though he was then only Lector of that
Church, and had been formerly one of <i>Lucilla</i>’s menial Servants<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c015'><sup>[540]</sup></a>.
To justify their Conduct, and their electing a new Bishop, they writ
Letters to all the Churches of <i>Africa</i>, filled with Calumnies against
<i>Cæcilianus</i>, and those who had ordained him. By these Letters great
Numbers were imposed upon, and misled; insomuch that, the People
being every-where divided, most Churches had Two Bishops, the one
ordained by <i>Majorinus</i>, and the other by <i>Cæcilianus</i><a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c015'><sup>[541]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Edicts enacted by</i><br/>Constantine, <i>in fav-<br/>our of the Christian<br/>Religion</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>About this time, that is, about the Year 313. <i>Constantine</i>, out of
his Zeal for the Christian Religion, issued Two Decrees, addressed to
<i>Anulinus</i>, Proconsul of <i>Africa</i>, the one commanding all the Places
in that Province to be restored, which had once belonged to the
Catholic Church, and might have been usurped during the Persecution<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c015'><sup>[542]</sup></a>;
and the other, exempting the Ecclesiastics from all civil
Functions<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c015'><sup>[543]</sup></a>. This Privilege was granted only to the Ecclesiastics of
the Catholic Church, whereof <i>Cæcilianus</i> was the Head, as was expresly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>declared in the Edict; and therefore to him alone the Proconsul
imparted it. It was a great Mortification to the <i>Donatists</i> to
see themselves thus disregarded by the Emperor: they therefore assembled
a few Days after, and drawing up a Petition to <i>Constantine</i>,
they delivered it, unsealed, to <i>Anulinus</i>, together with a Bundle of
Papers, sealed up in a Leather Bag, with this Title: <i>The Petition of
the Catholic Church, containing the Crimes of</i> Cæcilianus; <i>by the
Party of</i> Majorinus. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Donatists <i>petition</i><br/>Constantine, <i>that the<br/>Dispute may be re-<br/>ferred to the Bishops<br/>of</i> Gaul.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Substance of the Petition was, that the
Controversy between them and the other Bishops of <i>Africa</i> might be
referred to the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, who were free from the Imputation
of having delivered up the sacred Books to the Pagans<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c015'><sup>[544]</sup></a>. <i>Anulinus</i>
immediately dispatched a Messenger to the Emperor, both with the
Request, and the Papers, giving him, at the same time, by a Letter
still extant<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c015'><sup>[545]</sup></a>, an Insight into the Dispute, that made so great a Noise
in <i>Africa</i>. <i>Constantine</i>, who was then in <i>Gaul</i>, having received and
read all those Pieces, expressed great Concern to find the Christians
thus divided among themselves, and the Bishops at Variance with
one another<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c015'><sup>[546]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Bishops named<br/>by</i> Constantine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, he readily granted to the <i>Donatists</i> the
Judges they demanded, naming, for that Purpose, <i>Maternus</i> Bishop
of <i>Cologne</i>, <i>Rheticius</i> Bishop of <i>Autun</i>, and <i>Marinus</i> Bishop of
<i>Arles</i><a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c015'><sup>[547]</sup></a>; all Men of known Integrity, great Learning, and unblemished
Characters. To these, by a Letter under his own Hand, he
gave Notice of their new Commission; and, at the same time, for
their better Information, he caused Copies to be transmitted to them,
of all the Papers he had received from <i>Anulinus</i><a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c015'><sup>[548]</sup></a>. The Three
Bishops were ordered to repair, with all Speed, to <i>Rome</i>, and there,
jointly with <i>Melchiades</i>, Bishop of that City, to sit as Judges of
the Controversy. <i>Cæcilianus</i> likewise was ordered to <i>Rome</i>, and
allowed to take with him Ten Bishops of his Party, such as he should
judge the most capable of defending his Cause; and the same Liberty
was granted to the adverse Party<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c015'><sup>[549]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Letter to</i> Melchiades.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Constantine</i>, in the Letter he
writ on this Occasion to <i>Melchiades</i>, after appealing to him as a
Witness of the Respect and Veneration he had for the Catholic
Church, declares, he had nothing so much at Heart as to see her
Members happily united: he therefore earnestly intreats him to examine
the Affair with the utmost Attention, and, jointly with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, to judge it according to the strictest Laws of Justice
and Equity<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c015'><sup>[550]</sup></a>. In this Letter <i>Constantine</i> names no other Judges but
the Three Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, <i>Melchiades</i>, and one <i>Mark</i>, supposed to
have been Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, whom he joins with <i>Melchiades</i>;
but afterwards he ordered Seven more to be added to the Number,
and as many as could soon and conveniently assemble; so that they
were at last 19 in all<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c015'><sup>[551]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They met, for the first time, on <i>Friday</i> the

<i>Gaul</i>, with the Emperor her Husband. Before this Assembly <i>Cæcilianus</i>
appeared as the Person accused, and <i>Donatus</i> of <i>Casænigræ</i> as
the Accuser. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cæcilianus <i>absolved,<br/>and</i> Donatus<br/><i>condemned</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They had but Three Meetings: in the First the Characters
of the Accusers and Witnesses were strictly inquired into, and
their Depositions heard; in the Second the Acts of the Council of
<i>Carthage</i>, which had condemned <i>Cæcilianus</i>, as I have related above,
were examined; and in the last <i>Cæcilianus</i>, against whom nothing
had been proved, was absolved, and <i>Donatus</i> condemned as a Slanderer,
and the chief Author of the Schism<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c015'><sup>[554]</sup></a>. An Account of the
Whole, together with the Acts of the Council, was immediately
transmitted to <i>Constantine</i>, who began to flatter himself, that he had
put an End to the Dispute; for he could not imagine, that the <i>Donatists</i>
would appeal from the Judgment of such unexceptionable
Judges, of Judges whom they themselves had demanded. But the
good Prince was yet a Stranger to the Nature of religious Disputes,
to the Heat, Animosity, and enthusiastic Rancour, with which they
are commonly carried on. Notwithstanding the Pains he took, and
his Successors after him, and no Pains they spared, to heal these unhappy
Divisions, they continued, to the great Scandal of the Pagans,
rending the Church into most furious Parties and Factions, for the
Space of near 300 Years. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Melchiades <i>dies</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Council of <i>Rome</i> was held in the
Month of <i>October</i> 313, and <i>Melchiades</i> died on the Tenth of <i>January</i>
ensuing, <i>Volusianus</i> and <i>Anienus</i> being Consuls, having presided
for the Space of Two Years, Six Months, and Eight Days<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c015'><sup>[555]</sup></a>. About
an hundred Years after, the <i>Donatists</i> charged him with having delivered
up the sacred Books, and offered Incense to the Pagan Gods;
but this St. <i>Austin</i> calls a groundless Charge, a mere Calumny, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>malicious Invention of the <i>Donatists</i> of his Time to justify the Conduct
of their Predecessors, in appealing, as they did, from the Council
of <i>Rome</i>, at which <i>Melchiades</i> assisted, and probably presided, as Bishop
of the Imperial City<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c015'><sup>[556]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Whether the</i> Lateran<br/><i>Palace was given by</i><br/>Constantine <i>to</i><br/>Melchiades.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i>, impatient to see the Pope raised to the Rank of a
Prince, endeavours to prove, that <i>Melchiades</i> was placed in that
Station by <i>Constantine</i>, and argues thus: The Council of <i>Rome</i>
was held in the <i>Lateran</i> Palace; therefore that Palace had been
given by <i>Constantine</i> to <i>Melchiades</i>, and belonged to him; for
that an Assembly of Nineteen Bishops only should meet in so
spacious a Place, can no otherwise be accounted for, but by supposing
the Pope to have resided there. This he calls a Demonstration<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c015'><sup>[557]</sup></a>.
Having thus got him a Palace, and, no doubt, magnificently furnished,
he finds no Difficulty in equipping him in every other respect as a
Prince: For who can imagine, says he, that <i>Constantine</i>, so pious, so
generous a Prince, would have given to the Head of the Church a
Royal Palace to live in, and not allow him at the same time a suitable
Retinue, with suitable Appointments? To act otherwise, had not
been honouring, but disgracing the Christian Religion, since its High
Pontiff, stalking about all alone in a huge Palace, could be but an
Object of Ridicule to the Pontiffs of the Pagan Superstition, who
lived in magnificent Houses, with answerable Grandeur<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c015'><sup>[558]</sup></a>. Thus is the
Bishop metamorphosed at once into a Sovereign. But the Metamorphosis
is somewhat premature. If <i>Constantine</i>, yet a <i>Neophyte</i>, was
not well acquainted with the true Spirit of the Christian Religion,
<i>Melchiades</i> was; and therefore, had that Prince offered to distinguish
him by any such Marks of worldly Grandeur, I do not question but,
as he was a very good Man, he would have taken from thence an Opportunity
of instructing him better in the Principles of his new Profession,
and shewing him in what Contempt the Christian Prelates
had, and he himself ought to have, all worldly Grandeur. But no
such Offer was ever made or dreamt of: For what at length is all this
founded on? On the Meeting of the Council in the <i>Lateran</i> Palace.
The <i>French</i> Academy meet in the <i>Louvre</i>: Are they therefore
Princes? And does not <i>Optatus</i>, of whom we have the whole Account,
call it in express Terms the House of <i>Fausta</i><a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c015'><sup>[559]</sup></a>? <i>Fausta</i> perhaps
lived there, says <i>Baronius</i>, during the long and flourishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Reign of her Father <i>Maximian</i>, and thence it might be called the
House of <i>Fausta</i>. Thus in the End is his Demonstration dwindled
away to a mere Conjecture, and a very groundless one too: But,
waving that, why might not <i>Fausta</i> continue in the same Palace after
her Father’s Death, with her Husband <i>Constantine</i>, when he was at
<i>Rome</i>, or alone, when she did not attend him in the Wars? The
Annalist seems to have forgot that <i>Fausta</i> was <i>Constantine</i>’s Wife. But
after all, the Empress, as it appears to me, had only an Apartment in
the <i>Lateran</i>; for in this Sense I understand <i>Optatus</i> saying, <i>The Council
was held in the House, or Habitation, of</i> Fausta <i>in the</i> Lateran. But
her being any-ways there excludes <i>Melchiades</i>. Their sitting in the
Imperial Palace gave a kind of Authority and Sanction to their Decisions;
and besides, there might not be room in the House of <i>Melchiades</i>,
if he had a House, for the Council, and those who were to attend
it, they being in all Forty Bishops; so that we need not put <i>Melchiades</i>
in Possession of that Palace to account for the Council’s meeting in it,
as <i>Baronius</i> has done.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Sylvester</i> was chosen in the room of <i>Melchiades</i> on the last
of <i>January</i> 314<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c015'><sup>[560]</sup></a>. In his time were held the two great Councils
of <i>Arles</i> and <i>Nice</i>. The former was convened by <i>Constantine</i>’s Order
at the Request of the <i>Donatists</i>, who, instead of acquiescing to the
Judgment of the Council of <i>Rome</i>, loudly complained to the Emperor
of the Bishops who composed it, as partial, prejudiced, and
over-hasty in deciding a Controversy of the greatest Importance<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c015'><sup>[561]</sup></a>.
<i>Constantine</i> heard them with great Patience; and that he might leave
them no Colour or Pretence whatsoever to continue in their Schism,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council of</i> Arles.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  he summoned a second Council to meet at <i>Arles</i>, inviting several
Bishops to it with most pathetic Letters under his own Hand, and
ordering the Proconsuls and Governors of Provinces to acquaint the
rest with his Desire and Intention. <i>Chrestus</i>, or <i>Crescentius</i>, Bishop
of <i>Syracuse</i>, was allowed, and so, without all doubt, were the rest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to bring two Presbyters with him, and three Attendants, as we learn
from the Emperor’s Letter to him, which is still extant<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c015'><sup>[562]</sup></a>. They were
all to be supplied with Conveniences for traveling, and every thing
else, at the public Expence. The Time appointed for their Meeting
was the first of <i>August</i> 314. and on that Day they met accordingly<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c015'><sup>[563]</sup></a>,
not from all Parts of the World, as we read in the Acts of the Second
Council of <i>Arles</i><a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c015'><sup>[564]</sup></a>, but from <i>Africa</i>, and most other Provinces of the
West. <i>Sylvester</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i> was invited to it; but he excused
himself on account of his Age, and sent in his room the two Presbyters,
<i>Claudianus</i> and <i>Vitus</i>, with <i>Eugenius</i> and <i>Cyriacus</i>, Deacons;
the Bishop of <i>Ostia</i> sent likewise two Presbyters in his room<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c015'><sup>[565]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cæcilianus <i>declared<br/>innocent.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  By
this Assembly <i>Cæcilianus</i> was again declared innocent, and those who
should falsly accuse their Brethren cut off from the Communion of
the Church, without Hopes of being ever re-admitted, except at the
Point of Death<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c015'><sup>[566]</sup></a>. As to the schismatic Bishops, it was agreed, that
such of them as abandoned the Schism should not forfeit their Dignity,
but sit alternatively with the Catholic Bishop till one of them died<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c015'><sup>[567]</sup></a>.
The Council, before they broke up, acquainted the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>
with their Proceedings, and at the same time sent him the Decrees they
had made concerning the Discipline of the Church, not to be confirmed
by him, as <i>Baronius</i> would make us believe<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c015'><sup>[568]</sup></a>, but that <i>by his
means, as he held larger Dioceses, they might be the sooner known</i>.
These are the very Words of the Council<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c015'><sup>[569]</sup></a><a id='rN10' /><a href='#fN10' class='c015'><sup>[N10]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN10'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN10'>N10</a>. Several Canons were made by this
Council relating to the Discipline of the
Church. 1. It was ordained, that <i>Easter</i>
should be kept on the same Day, and on a
<i>Sunday</i>, by all the Churches in the World;
and that the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> should acquaint
the other Churches with the Day. But it
was afterwards ordained, that the Bishop of
<i>Alexandria</i> should fix the Day, and give
timely notice of it to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>,
that by his means it might be notified to
the whole Church. This Ordinance St.
<i>Cyril</i> seems to ascribe to the Council of
<i>Nice</i>; for he says, that it was <i>so enacted by
the Synod composed of all the Saints of the
Earth</i>; which, at the Time he writ,
that is, about the Year 360. could be said
of no other Synod but that of <i>Nice</i>. Pope
<i>Leo the Great</i>, speaking of this Custom in
a Letter to the Emperor <i>Marcian</i>, only
says, that it was <i>established by the holy Fathers</i><a id='rN10.1' /><a href='#fN10.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
He meant, perhaps, the Fathers
of <i>Nice</i>. But as they took no notice of
such a Custom in their Letter to the Church
of <i>Egypt</i>, I cannot suppose it to have been
introduced by them. The Care of fixing
the Day, and acquainting the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i> with it, was probably committed to
the Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, because the <i>Egyptians</i>
were thought to be better acquainted
with the Motions of the heavenly Bodies
than any other Nation. In other Provinces
the Bishops seem to have been utter
Strangers to Astronomy, and to that Ignorance
was chiefly owing their Disagreement
with respect to the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>.
This Custom still obtained in the Fifth Century,
as appears from a Letter of <i>Leo the
Great</i>, dated the 28th of <i>July</i> 454. For
by that Letter he acquaints the Bishops of
<i>Gaul</i> and <i>Spain</i>, that the following Year
455, <i>Easter</i> would fall on the 24th of <i>April</i>,
<i>as it had been settled in the East</i><a id='rN10.2' /><a href='#fN10.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Before
his Time <i>Innocent</i> I. being at a Loss to
know on what Day <i>Easter</i> should be kept
in 414. had recourse to <i>Aurelius</i> Bishop of
<i>Carthage</i>, intreating him to examine that
Point in a Council, and let him know what
they determined, that he might notify it,
as was customary, to other Churches. <i>Innocent</i>
had quarreled, on <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Account,
with the Eastern Bishops; and therefore
chose rather to be informed and directed
by the <i>African</i> Bishops than by them.
2. It was decreed, that such as had been
baptized by Heretics in the Name of the
Trinity, should not be rebaptized, but
admitted into the Church only by the Imposition
of Hands. But to this Decree of
the Council no greater Regard was paid,
than had been paid in St. <i>Cyprian</i>’s Time
to the Decisions of Pope <i>Stephen</i>. For in
the Year 370. the same Practice of rebaptizing
Heretics still obtained in several
Churches of <i>Africa</i>, as appears from <i>Optatus</i>,
who writ about that time. In the
East some held, and some denied, the Validity
of Baptism administred by an Heretic.
Of the latter Opinion was the great <i>Athanasius</i>,
who flourished from the Year 326.
to 373. and St. <i>Basil</i>, who writ about the
Year 369. after examining, in his Letter
to <i>Amphilochus</i>, the two opposite Practices,
seems inclined to think the Baptism of
Heretics null. According to the present
Doctrine of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, Baptism,
by whomsoever administred, whether <i>Jew</i>,
<i>Gentile</i>, Heretic, <i>Mohammedan</i>, &amp;c. whether
Man or Woman, or even a Child, is
valid, provided it be only administred with
an Intention of administring it, without
which every Sacrament, say they, is null.
This Doctrine, with respect to the Intention,
proves daily to timorous Consciences
the Source of endless Doubts and Perplexities,
which can never be removed: for tho’
they may know for certain, that the Ceremony
was performed, yet they can never
know whether or no it was performed with
the due Intention. In Confession, for Instance,
they may hear the Words of the
Absolution pronounced by the Priest; but
they know nothing of his Intention, of the
Intention of the Minister who baptized
him, of the Bishop who ordained him, of
the Priest who baptized, or the Bishops
who ordained that Bishop, and so up to the
Apostles, by whom the first Bishops were
ordained. Should the right Intention have
been wanting in any of these; should the
Priest, while he pronounces the Words of
Absolution, have his Thoughts employed
on some other Object, as it may easily
happen; the penitent Sinner would depart
from his Tribunal with the whole Load of
his Sins, and be damned, notwithstanding
his Repentance, for, or, more properly
speaking, thro' want of Attention in the
Priest. A most unchristian and impious
Doctrine, placing our eternal Salvation in
the Hands of others, and not in our own.
3. The Council decreed, that excommunicated
Persons should be no-where absolved
from the Excommunication but in the Places
where they had been excommunicated.
The Bishops of <i>Rome</i> did not yet know,
it seems, that they were vested with an unlimited
Power of binding and loosening,
of excommunicating and absolving, with
respect to all Persons and Places; for had
<i>Sylvester</i> but dreamt of such a Power, we
may well suppose he would never have suffered
it to be thus controuled. Several
other Canons were made by this Council,
in all Twenty-two; but it is foreign to my
Purpose to take notice of them. I shall
only observe, that the Council consisted of
Thirty-three Bishops, and not of Two
hundred, as <i>Baronius</i> supposes, upon the
Authority of St. <i>Austin</i>, whom he misunderstood;
and that <i>Marinus</i> Bishop of <i>Arles</i>
presided, his Name being placed at the
Head of the Subscriptions, and the Names
of <i>Sylvester</i>’s Legates after his.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The other grand Council that was held during the Pontificate of
<i>Sylvester</i> was that of <i>Nice</i>, so famous in the History of the Church:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>but the Bishop of the reigning City, says <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c015'><sup>[570]</sup></a>, being prevented
by his great Age from undertaking so long a Journey, he sent <i>Vitus</i>
and <i>Vincentius</i>, Two <i>Roman</i> Presbyters, to supply his room<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c015'><sup>[571]</sup></a>, with
Orders to agree in his Name to the Decisions of the Council<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c015'><sup>[572]</sup></a>. In
Process of Time such Orders grew out of Date, and the modest Name
of <i>Roman</i> Presbyters, given to those who were sent by the Bishops of
<i>Rome</i>, either to Councils or Princes, was changed into the lofty Title
of <i>Legates a latere</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Osius <i>did not assist<br/>at the Council of</i><br/>Nice <i>as the Pope’s<br/>Legate</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Baronius</i><a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c015'><sup>[573]</sup></a>, and after him most Writers of the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, maintain <i>Osius</i>, the celebrated Bishop of <i>Cordoua</i>,
to have assisted, nay, and presided at the Council of <i>Nice</i> as the
Pope’s Legate. <i>Vitus</i> and <i>Vincentius</i>, say they, represented the Person
of the Pope; but <i>Osius</i> held his Place, and the Place of all the
Bishops of the West. That <i>Osius</i> assisted at the Council with the
Character of the Pope’s Legate, is affirmed, I own, by <i>Gelasius</i> of
<i>Cyzicus</i>, who flourished about the End of the Fifth Century<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c015'><sup>[574]</sup></a>: but
<i>Eusebius</i>, who was present, mentions only <i>Vitus</i> and <i>Vincentius</i> as
sent thither by <i>Sylvester</i>. In like manner all the Historians, who have
written of that Council after <i>Eusebius</i> till the Time of <i>Gelasius</i>, in
naming those Two Presbyters and <i>Osius</i>, which they all do, constantly
distinguish the former by the Title of the Deputies, the Representatives,
<i>&amp;c.</i> of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and never the latter. Besides,
<i>Vitus</i> and <i>Vincentius</i>, in subscribing to the Canons of the Council,
declare, that they do it <i>in the Name of the venerable Pope</i>, or Father,
<i>Sylvester their Bishop</i><a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c015'><sup>[575]</sup></a>; whereas <i>Osius</i> subscribes, like the other Bishops,
in his own Name. As to his presiding at that great Assembly,
his Name, 'tis true, is marked the first by <i>Socrates</i><a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c015'><sup>[576]</sup></a>, among those
who subscribed to the Definitions and Canons of the Council; but yet
I am inclined to believe that Honour not to have been conferred upon
him, but upon <i>Eustathius</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nor did he preside.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  for <i>John</i>, Bishop of
the same City, writing to <i>Proculus</i> about the Year 435. styles him the
first of the Fathers assembled at <i>Nice</i><a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c015'><sup>[577]</sup></a>, and <i>Facundus</i> calls him the
first of the Council<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c015'><sup>[578]</sup></a>. In the Chronicle of <i>Nicephorus</i> he is styled
the Head of the Fathers of <i>Nice</i><a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c015'><sup>[579]</sup></a>: and from <i>Theodoret</i> we learn, that
he sat the first on the Right-hand in the Assembly, and harangued the
Emperor<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c015'><sup>[580]</sup></a>, which it was the President’s Province to do<a id='rN11' /><a href='#fN11' class='c015'><sup>[N11]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The Honour of presiding belonged of Right to <i>Alexander</i> Bishop of
<i>Alexandria</i>; but he, it seems, declined it, perhaps to obviate the
Complaints of the <i>Arians</i>, who looked upon him as a Party concerned,
and one highly prejudiced against them. I know that the
haranguing of <i>Constantine</i> is ascribed to <i>Eusebius</i> the Historian, in the
Title of the Chapter in which he mentions it<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c015'><sup>[581]</sup></a>, that <i>Sozomen</i> positively
affirms it, and that the learned <i>Valesius</i> thinks there is no room to
doubt of it, since <i>Eusebius</i> was the most eloquent Bishop of those
Times; and besides, he himself tells us, that he pronounced a Speech
in Praise of <i>Constantine</i>, on occasion of his entering into the Twentieth
Year of his Reign, while he was sitting in the midst of the Ministers of
God<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c015'><sup>[582]</sup></a>; meaning thereby, no doubt, the Bishops assembled at <i>Nice</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Eusebius <i>of</i> Cæsarea<br/><i>did not harangue the<br/>Emperor at the Opening of the<br/>Council</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  That <i>Eusebius</i> harangued the Emperor before that venerable Assembly,
is not at all to be questioned; but that the Bishops, who composed it,
should have pitched upon one who was suspected, or rather convicted,
of <i>Arianism</i>, to address the Emperor in their Name, at the Opening
of the Council, seems to me highly improbable. The Orator, whoever
he was, sat in the first Place, or at least in the second (that I
may not quarrel with <i>Baronius</i>, who will have the Place on the Left-hand
to have been the most honourable<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c015'><sup>[583]</sup></a>): And what Right had the
Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i> to that Honour? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but on another<br/>Occasion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  I may add, that a short Compliment,
such as is that which the Presbyter <i>Gregory</i> ascribes to <i>Eustathius</i>
of <i>Antioch</i><a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c015'><sup>[584]</sup></a>, had been far more proper on that Occasion than
<i>Eusebius</i>’s long and tedious Panegyric, which therefore some suppose
to have been pronounced on Occasion of the magnificent Entertainment
which <i>Constantine</i> gave the Bishops, as they were preparing to
return to their respective Sees; for he then entered into the Twentieth
Year of his Reign, which began on the 25th of <i>July</i> 325. and it was
on that Occasion that <i>Eusebius</i> writ, and delivered his Panegyric
before the Emperor, and the Fathers of the Council, as he himself
declares<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c015'><sup>[585]</sup></a>. To conclude, had <i>Eusebius</i> been appointed by that great
Assembly to address the Emperor in their Name, his Modesty had not
prevented him from describing the Spokesman so as to leave no room
to doubt on whom that Honour had been conferred.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i> Nice<br/><i>not convened by the<br/>Pope</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Before I dismiss this Subject, it may not be improper, nor foreign

writ, for several Ages after<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c015'><sup>[586]</sup></a>; nay, it was understood in this Sense
by some of the Popes themselves, namely, by <i>Innocent</i> I. who, in one
of his Letters to <i>Victricius</i> Bishop of <i>Roan</i>, writes thus; <i>If any Controversy
should arise among the Clerks, whether they be of an inferior
or superior Rank, let it be decided, agreeably to the Council of</i> Nice,
<i>in an Assembly of the Bishops of the same Province</i><a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c015'><sup>[587]</sup></a>. 'Tis true, he
adds, <i>without prejudicing the Rights of the</i> Roman <i>See</i>. But that
Restriction is his own, and not the Council’s. Hence this Canon,
directing all Causes to be thus tried, all Disputes to be thus ended,
was often quoted on occasion of Appeals made to <i>Rome</i>, and employed
as a Bulwark to restrain the incroaching Power of the Popes
within due Bounds; but in Process of Time their Ambition, supported
by the Favour of Princes, and the great Temporalities they acquired,
bore all down before them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Ecclesiastical<br/>Hierarchy first<br/>formed.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It was in the Pontificate of <i>Sylvester</i>, and under the benign Auspices
of <i>Constantine</i>, that the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy was first formed and
settled in the Manner it continues to this Day; the new Form of Government,
introduced by that Prince into the State, serving as a Model
for the Government of the Church. In the Three first Centuries no
other Hierarchy was known, no other Degrees thought of, but those
of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons. Of these alone was composed
the whole Body of the Clergy; but with this Difference, that the
Bishop or Supervisor was the general Disposer and Manager of all
Things within the Bounds of his Jurisdiction, nothing being done there
without his Consent and Approbation, and the Presbyters and Deacons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>his Assistants, or his Counsellors and Senate, as St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c015'><sup>[588]</sup></a>, and
before him St. <i>Ignatius</i><a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c015'><sup>[589]</sup></a>, styled them. This Order was probably introduced,
according to <i>Grotius</i><a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c015'><sup>[590]</sup></a>, in Imitation of the <i>Jewish</i> Synagogues;
for each Synagogue had its Ruler, who presided over the rest,
its Pastors, and its Eleemosynaries; to the Ruler succeeded the Bishop,
to the Pastors the Presbyters, and to the Eleemosynaries the Deacons.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Office and<br/>Duty of Bishops.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It was the Bishop’s Office and Duty to preach the Word<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c015'><sup>[591]</sup></a>, to pray with
his People<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c015'><sup>[592]</sup></a> to administer the Sacraments<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c015'><sup>[593]</sup></a>, to ordain Ministers<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c015'><sup>[594]</sup></a>, to
excommunicate Offenders<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c015'><sup>[595]</sup></a>, to absolve Penitents<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c015'><sup>[596]</sup></a>, and to regulate
and settle every thing relating to his particular Church<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c015'><sup>[597]</sup></a>, with the
Consent and Concurrence of the Presbytery; for the Presbyters were
his Counsellors or Senate, and, together with him, presided in the
Consistories of those Times, as we learn from <i>Tertullian</i> telling us,
that in those Courts <i>approved Elders presided</i><a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c015'><sup>[598]</sup></a>. Hence <i>Petrus de
Marca</i> concludes the original Government of the Church to have been
mixt of Monarchy and Aristocracy; or, to use his own Words, the
Monarchical Government of the Church to have been tempered with
the Aristocratical. As the Bishop could not discharge, as he ought,
the above-mentioned Functions, without residing among those who
were committed to his Care, his Residence was deemed absolutely
necessary, and Non-residence a most heinous Transgression; insomuch
that St. <i>Cyprian</i>, enumerating the Sins that brought the Wrath of
God upon the Church in the bloody Persecution of <i>Decius</i>, mentions
Non-residence in the Bishops as one<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c015'><sup>[599]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How chosen,<br/>and ordained.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Upon the Vacancy of a See
a new Bishop was chosen in the room of the deceased in some Places
by the Clergy and People of that Church alone, in others by the
neighbouring Bishops, the People and the Clergy only expressing their
Desire, and giving Testimony of the Life and Manners of the Person
proposed, and in some by the joint Suffrages of the Clergy, of the
People, and of the neighbouring Bishops. These three different Methods
of electing we find practised at different Times with respect to
the same Church; but on no Occasion was the Choice of the neighbouring
Bishops sufficient without the Consent of the Clergy and
People, nor the Election of the Clergy and People without the Approbation
of the neighbouring Bishops. The Bishop being thus elected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and confirmed, he was in the next Place ordained; and this Ceremony
was performed by the neighbouring Bishops, in his own Church, and
in the Presence of his Flock, by the Imposition of Hands. The
new Bishop, agreeably to a Custom which obtained then, immediately
gave Notice of his Promotion to other Bishops, especially to those
of the greater Sees, who, by receiving and answering his Letters,
were said to communicate with him, and to acknowlege him lawfully
chosen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Office and Duty<br/>of Presbyters.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the Second Degree were the Presbyters or Priests, whose Office
or Province it was to assist the Bishop in the Discharge of his Pastoral
Commission, whence they are often styled the Bishop’s Assistants:
with his Consent and Approbation they preached the Word, they
prayed with the People, they administred the Sacraments, they absolved
Penitents, and, in short, discharged every Office which the
Bishop did, except those of ordaining, confirming, and excommunicating;
I say, with the Bishop’s Consent and Approbation; for no
spiritual Function could they perform without his Leave, as is manifest
from <i>Tertullian</i><a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c015'><sup>[600]</sup></a>, <i>Origen</i><a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c015'><sup>[601]</sup></a>, St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c015'><sup>[602]</sup></a>, and above all from
St. <i>Ignatius</i>, in his famous Letter to the Church of <i>Smyrna</i><a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c015'><sup>[603]</sup></a>. The
Church, in those happy Days, admitted none to the sacred Functions,
but such as were known by a long Trial to be well qualified for so
great a Charge. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Qualifications re-<br/>quisite in a Presbyter.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Qualifications requisite in a Presbyter, so far as
I can learn from the Antients, may be reduced to these Four Heads,
his Condition in the World, his Conversation, his Learning, and his
Age. He was not to be intangled with any worldly Affairs, with any
secular Employments, but at perfect Liberty to apply himself wholly
to the Functions of his Office<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c015'><sup>[604]</sup></a>. He was to be of an unspotted and
exemplary Life<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c015'><sup>[605]</sup></a>; and therefore, before Ordination, he was proposed
to the Presbytery and People for their Testimony and Approbation.
He was to be well versed in the Scripture, and capable of teaching
others, and instructing them in the Mysteries of the Christian Religion.
As for human Learning, it was not required in a Presbyter;
nay, by some it was condemned, particularly Logic and Philosophy,
as in a manner inconsistent with Christianity<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c015'><sup>[606]</sup></a>, but at the same time
highly commended and applauded by others as conducive to the right
understanding of the Scripture, and necessary for confuting the Sophisms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of Heretics<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c015'><sup>[607]</sup></a>; whence Logic especially is recommended by
<i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i> to all Ecclesiastics, as <i>a Hedge to defend the
Truth from being trod down by Sophists</i><a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c015'><sup>[608]</sup></a>. As for the Age of a Presbyter,
he was to be stricken in Years, as the very Name of a Presbyter
or Elder sufficiently declares. However, if a young Man was endowed
with extraordinary Gifts and Talents, his Age was dispensed
with in respect both to the Sacerdotal and Episcopal Dignity. Thus
was <i>Aurelius</i>, though young in Years, raised, in regard of his great
Merit, to the Rank of a Presbyter, as we read in St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c015'><sup>[609]</sup></a>; and
the Bishop of <i>Magnesia</i>, in St. <i>Ignatius</i>’s Time, was, it seems, but
a young Man, since <i>Ignatius</i>, in his Letter to the <i>Magnesians</i>, exhorts
them <i>not to despise their Bishop’s Age, but to yield him all due Respect
and Reverence</i><a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c015'><sup>[610]</sup></a>. These were the Qualifications requisite in a
Candidate for the Ministry: if he was recommended by them (for no
other Recommendation could avail him), he was admitted to holy
Orders; if not, he was rejected as unfit for the sacred Function. The
Person ordained was at Liberty to serve the Church where he had
received his Orders, or any other where his Assistance might be wanted;
for he was not ordained Minister of any particular Church, but of the
Church universal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Institution and<br/>Office of Deacons.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>In the Third and last Degree were the Deacons, whose original Institution
was to <i>serve Tables</i>, as we read in the <i>Acts</i><a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c015'><sup>[611]</sup></a>; that is, to inspect
the Poor, and relieve them by a proper Distribution of the Offerings
made by the Faithful, which were committed to their Charge,
though they could not dispose of them without the Bishop’s Knowlege<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c015'><sup>[612]</sup></a>.
They were ordained by the Imposition of Hands<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c015'><sup>[613]</sup></a>, and therefore
deemed Ministers of the Altar, as well as Dispensers of Alms;
and with a great deal of Reason, for they assisted the Bishops or Presbyters
in administring the Eucharist, by delivering the Elements to the
Communicants<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c015'><sup>[614]</sup></a>; they carried the Eucharist to such as had not been
able to assist with the rest at Divine Service<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c015'><sup>[615]</sup></a>; they preached, and, in
the Absence of the Bishop and Presbyters, conferred the Sacrament
of Baptism<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c015'><sup>[616]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their Number.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Presbyters of a Church were not confined to a set
Number; but the Deacons were, no Church having more than Seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>in the primitive Times, that being the original Number instituted by
the Apostles. Thus the Church of <i>Rome</i> had but Seven in the Times
of Pope <i>Cornelius</i><a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c015'><sup>[617]</sup></a>, and Pope <i>Sixtus</i> II<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c015'><sup>[618]</sup></a>, the Church of <i>Saragosa</i>
the same Number in the Time of <i>Vincentius</i>, who flourished under
<i>Dioclesian</i><a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c015'><sup>[619]</sup></a>. The Fourteenth Canon of the Council of <i>Neocæsarea</i>,
or the Fifteenth, according to the <i>Greek</i>, forbids this Number to be
inlarged, even in the greatest and most populous Cities<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c015'><sup>[620]</sup></a>; whence
St. <i>Jerom</i> writes, that great Respect was paid to the Deacons, because
they were few in Number<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c015'><sup>[621]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Subdeacons</i>,<br/><i>Acolytes</i>,<br/><i>Readers</i>,3] &amp;c.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Subdeacons, Acolytes, Lectors, Janitors, and Exorcists,
they were not considered as any-ways belonging to the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy, being employed only in the meaner Offices of the Church,
by the due Discharge of which they were to give Proof of their Integrity
and Attention, in order to be raised to a higher Degree; for in
those Days very few, and none but upon some very extraordinary
Occasion, arrived at once, or, as they call it, <i>per saltum</i>, at the Episcopal
Dignity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Each Church inde-<br/>pendent.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>During the Three first Centuries each Church was in a manner independent,
that is, could make such Regulations relating to its Discipline
and Government as were judged proper and expedient, without
the Concurrence and Authority of other Churches<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c015'><sup>[622]</sup></a>. However, in all
Matters of Moment, the Bishops used to advise with one another,
especially with those of the same Province, who frequently met to
settle all Ecclesiastical Affairs within their respective Limits.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Frequent Synods held.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Firmilian</i>,
Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i> in <i>Cappadocia</i>, writes, that in his Province they
met every Year<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c015'><sup>[623]</sup></a>; and from the frequent Synods mentioned by St.
<i>Cyprian</i>, we may conclude them to have been held in that Province
at least once a Year. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Of whom composed.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  These Synods or Assemblies were composed of
Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Laymen, representing the People
of their several Churches<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c015'><sup>[624]</sup></a>. They met by their own Appointment
and Authority, there being no Christian Magistrates in those Days to
convene Synods. Being thus assembled, they chose in the first place
one, and sometimes two Bishops, to preside<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c015'><sup>[625]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Method they held.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It was their Office
and Duty to see the Point in question calmly and fairly debated, to
sum up in each Debate what had been urged on both Sides, to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the Votes and Suffrages of the Members of the Synod, and last of all
to give their own<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c015'><sup>[626]</sup></a>. In these Assemblies all Ecclesiastical Affairs were
settled by the Majority of Votes, and their Decrees and Decisions were
binding with respect to those Churches whose Representatives were
present<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c015'><sup>[627]</sup></a>; but were not so with respect to other Churches.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Ecclesiastical<br/>Policy adapted to<br/>the Civil.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Such was the Hierarchy, such the Government of the Church, during
the Three first Centuries. But in the Fourth and following Ages great
Alterations were made in both, the Church adapting her Government
to that of the State, namely, to the new Form of Government introduced
by <i>Constantine</i>, who had settled her in Peace, and taken the
Priesthood into his immediate Protection. For it was in his Reign
that the Titles of <i>Patriarchs</i>, <i>Exarchs</i>, <i>Metropolitans</i>, were first heard
of, or at least had any Power, Authority, or Privileges, annexed to
them. That this Conformity between the Civil and Ecclesiastical Polity
may appear more plainly, I shall premise a succinct Account of the
former, as established by <i>Constantine</i> throughout the Empire. That
Prince divided the whole <i>Roman</i> World into four Prefectures, <i>viz.</i>
the <i>East</i>, <i>Illyricum</i>, <i>Gaul</i>, and <i>Italy</i>, which were governed by four
Prefects, called <i>Præfecti Prætorio</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The new Form of<br/>Government intro-<br/>duced by</i> Con-<br/>stantine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Till his Time the whole Empire
was governed under the Emperors by Two Prefects only, as <i>Zosimus</i>
informs us<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c015'><sup>[628]</sup></a>; and this Division is supposed to have been made by
<i>Constantine</i>, jealous of the too great Power of those Magistrates. Each
Prefecture was subdivided into several Dioceses, and each Diocese into
several Provinces. Thus the Prefecture of the <i>East</i> contained Five
Dioceses; <i>viz.</i> the <i>East</i> divided into Ten Provinces, <i>Egypt</i> into Six,
<i>Pontus</i> into Eleven, <i>Asia</i> into Ten, and <i>Thrace</i> into Six. Under
the Prefecture of <i>Illyricum</i> were Two Dioceses; <i>Macedon</i>, consisting
of Eight Provinces; and <i>Dacia</i>, consisting of four. The Prefecture
of <i>Gaul</i> comprised Three Dioceses, <i>Gaul</i> made up of Seventeen
Provinces, <i>Spain</i> of Seven, and <i>Britain</i> of Five. The Prefecture
of <i>Italy</i> was divided into Two Vicarages or Lieutenancies; the one of
<i>Rome</i>, comprehending Ten Provinces, under the Vicar of <i>Rome</i>,
whence they were called <i>Suburbicarian</i> Provinces; the other of <i>Italy</i>,
containing Seven Provinces, governed by the Vicar of <i>Italy</i>, who resided
at <i>Milan</i>, whence they were simply called Provinces of <i>Italy</i>.
Under the Prefect of <i>Italy</i> was likewise <i>West Africa</i>, and after <i>Constantine</i>’s
Death <i>West Illyricum</i>. The Prefects had other Officers
under them, by whom the Provinces were more immediately governed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>These were, to name them according to their Rank and Dignity,
Proconsuls, Vicars, Consulars, Correctors, and Presidents. Each
Diocese had its Metropolis, and likewise each Province contained in
the Diocese.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Civil and<br/>Ecclesiastical<br/>Polity compared.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Now, if we compare the Civil Polity, thus described, with the Ecclesiastical,
we shall find them in most Places answering each other, in
every respect, and one Bishop raised above the rest, according to the
Rank that was given by this new Division to the City in which he presided.
Thus, for Instance, the chief Cities of the Five Dioceses of the
Oriental Prefecture were; <i>Antioch</i>, the Metropolis of the Oriental
Diocese; <i>Alexandria</i>, of the <i>Egyptian</i>; <i>Ephesus</i>, of the <i>Asiatic</i>;
<i>Cæsarea</i>, of the <i>Pontic</i>; and <i>Heraclea</i>, of the <i>Thracian</i>. Now the
Bishops of these Cities, in regard of the Eminence of their Sees, were
exalted above all other Bishops, and distinguished with the Title of
Exarchs; nay, and by Degrees they acquired, not to say usurped, a
kind of Authority and Jurisdiction over the Bishops of the inferior
Sees, which was afterwards confirmed to them by several Councils.
In like manner the Bishop of the Metropolis of each Province was,
on account of the Dignity of his See, honoured with the Title of
Metropolitan, to which were annexed several Privileges, of which I
shall speak hereafter. When one Province was divided into Two, which
often happened, the Ecclesiastical Polity was likewise altered, and the
Bishop of the new Metropolis raised to the Dignity of a Metropolitan.
Several Instances might be alleged of ambitious Bishops applying to the
Emperors for a Division of the Province, that their City might acquire
the Title of Metropolis, and they, of course, that of Metropolitans.
When the City of <i>Byzantium</i> was declared the Metropolis of another
Empire, the Exarchate of <i>Heraclea</i>, the Metropolis of the <i>Thracian</i>
Diocese, was, by that Change, transferred from <i>Heraclea</i> to the
new Metropolis; so that the Bishop of <i>Heraclea</i> became Suffragan to
the Bishop of <i>Byzantium</i>, or, as it was then called, <i>Constantinople</i>,
who, till that Time, had been Suffragan to him. Upon the Division of
a Province, the Churches were likewise divided, and the Bishop of the
new Metropolis acquired all the Privileges and Power of a Metropolitan
over the Churches taken by the Change in the Civil Government from
the antient Metropolis. But it was afterwards decreed, by the Council
of <i>Chalcedon</i>, that if any City should be raised to the Dignity of a
Metropolis, the Bishop of that City should enjoy the Title, but not
the Privileges of a Metropolitan. Thus the Bishops of <i>Nice</i> and <i>Berytus</i>
were honoured with the Title of Metropolitans, and took Place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>of all the other Bishops of those Provinces; but nevertheless continued
to be Suffragans to their antient Metropolitans the Bishops of <i>Nicomedia</i>
and <i>Tyre</i>. For the same Reason several Bishops in the Kingdom
of <i>Naples</i> enjoy, to this Day, the Title of Metropolitans; but neither
have, nor ever had, any Province or Suffragans. The above-mentioned
Decree was enacted by the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i>, to prevent the
Bishops from recurring, as they often did, to the Emperors,and to obviate
the frequent Changes that were thereby introduced into the Church.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Prefectures of</i><br/>Illyricum, Gaul, <i>and</i><br/>Spain.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Prefecture of <i>Illyricum</i> had but one Exarch, the Bishop of
<i>Thessalonica</i>, the Metropolis of the <i>Macedonian</i> Diocese. In the Prefecture
of <i>Gaul</i> there was no Exarch, but in the Two Dioceses of
<i>Gaul</i> and <i>Spain</i> as many Metropolitans as Provinces. Some there
were, without all Doubt, in the Diocese of <i>Britain</i>, which was
divided into Five Provinces, <i>viz.</i> <i>Maxima Cæsariensis</i>, <i>Britannia
Prima</i>, <i>Britannia Secunda</i>, <i>Valentia</i>, and <i>Flavia Cæsariensis</i>. But
in this Island an intire Change was made, by the <i>Saxons</i>, both in the
Ecclesiastical and Civil Polity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Prefecture of</i><br/>Italy.</div>

<p class='c001'>Under the Prefect of <i>Italy</i> were Three Dioceses, <i>viz.</i> <i>Italy</i>, <i>West
Illyricum</i>, and <i>West Africa</i>. The Diocese of <i>Italy</i> was divided into
Two Vicarages, as I have observed above, and governed by Two Vicars;
the one called the Vicar of <i>Rome</i>, and residing in that City,
the other styled the Vicar of <i>Italy</i>, and residing at <i>Milan</i>. Under
the former were Ten Provinces, <i>viz.</i> <i>Campania</i>, <i>Apulia</i>, <i>Lucania</i>,
<i>Hetruria</i>, <i>Umbria</i>, <i>Picenum Suburbicarium</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Sardinia</i>, <i>Corsica</i>,
and <i>Valeria</i>; and Seven under the latter, <i>viz.</i> <i>Liguria</i>, <i>Æmilia</i>,
<i>Flaminia</i> or <i>Picenum Annonarium</i>, <i>Venetia</i>, <i>Istria</i>, <i>Alpes Cottiæ</i>, and
the Two <i>Rhætiæ</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Ecclesiastical<br/>Polity there intirely<br/>agreeable to the Civil.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Such was the Civil Government of <i>Italy</i>, and intirely
agreeable to the Civil was the Ecclesiastical. Thus the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i> enjoyed all the Privileges of a Metropolitan, with respect to
the Bishops of the Provinces subject to the Vicar of that City, or
the <i>Suburbicarian</i> Provinces, as they are styled by <i>Ruffinus</i>. In like
manner the Bishop of <i>Milan</i> exercised the Power and Authority of
a Metropolitan over all the Bishops under the Vicar of <i>Italy</i>. But the
Power of both was confined within the Limits of their respective
Vicarages. As neither had the Charge of a whole Diocese, they were
not, like several Bishops in the East, distinguished with the Title of
Exarch, which they had no Right to, but with that only of Metropolitan.
However, the Power of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> far exceeded,
within the Bounds of his Jurisdiction, that of other Metropolitans, as
I shall shew hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Ecclesiastical<br/>Polity in</i> Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>In <i>Africa</i> the Ecclesiastical Polity varied greatly from the Civil.
<i>Carthage</i> indeed, in the Proconsular Province of <i>Africa</i>, properly so
called, was the Metropolis of all <i>West Africa</i>, and the Bishop of that
City the Primate and Exarch. But in the other Five Provinces of
that Diocese, <i>viz.</i> <i>Numidia</i>, the Two <i>Mauritanias</i>, <i>Cæsariensis</i> and
<i>Sitifensis</i>, <i>Tingitana</i>, <i>Bizacena</i>, and <i>Tripolitana</i>, the senior Bishop,
in what City soever he presided, enjoyed the Title and Privileges of
Metropolitan, Regard being had to his Seniority, or the Time of his
Ordination, and none to the Dignity of his See. And hence it is
that, at different times, we find Bishops of different Cities, within
the same Province, acting as <i>Metropolitans</i>. Of <i>West Illyricum</i>, the
Third Diocese under the Prefect of <i>Italy</i>, I shall have Occasion to
speak hereafter.</p>

taken a great deal of Pains to prove, that these Ecclesiastical Dignities
owe their Origin to <i>Christ</i>, or the Apostles. But their Arguments
are unanswerably confuted by the learned <i>Ellies du Pin</i><a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c015'><sup>[633]</sup></a>;
and, besides, it is evident, from the intire Conformity which the
Ecclesiastical Government had, in most Places, with the Political State
of the Empire, as established by <i>Constantine</i>, that the Church, in forming
the Hierarchy I have described, adopted his Plan; and consequently,
that such Dignities are not of divine, but of human Institution.
I might add, that it cannot be proved from Scripture, that
the Apostles, in appointing Bishops, gave more Power to one than to
another, or any Power at all to one over the others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The new Dignities<br/>added to the antient<br/>Hierarchy of the<br/>Church.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The new Dignities or Degrees, added to the antient Hierarchy of
the Church, in the Fourth and following Centuries, were those of
<i>Metropolitan</i>, <i>Primate</i>, <i>Archbishop</i>, <i>Exarch</i>, and <i>Patriarch</i>. The
Title of <i>Metropolitan</i> was given to the Bishop of the chief City of
a Province, and likewise that of <i>Primate</i>, he being <i>primus</i>, or the first
of the Province; for such was the original Signification of that Word
in an Ecclesiastical Sense; but, in Process of Time, the Title of <i>Primate</i>
was restrained to the Bishops of some great Cities. On the
contrary the Title of <i>Archbishop</i> was originally bestowed on Metropolitans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>only of great Eminence and Distinction; but, in the Eighth
Century, it began to be given indifferently to all Metropolitans, and
even to some Bishops, distinguished by no other Title. As the Bishop
of the Metropolis, or chief City, of a Province, was dignified with
the Title of <i>Metropolitan</i>, so was the Bishop of the Metropolis, or
chief City of a Diocese, with that of <i>Exarch</i>; which, however, we
find sometimes given to Metropolitans. As for the Title of <i>Patriarch</i>,
it was first common to all Bishops, but afterwards confined to the
Exarchs; and lastly, to the Bishops of the Five following Cities, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Rome</i>, <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Alexandria</i>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>. It was
first bestowed on the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, by the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i><a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c015'><sup>[634]</sup></a>,
after it had been long common to all the Exarchs of the East, as the
learned <i>Du Pin</i> well observes<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c015'><sup>[635]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Rights and Priv-<br/>ileges of Metropolitans.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Titles of Metropolitans, Primates, Exarchs, and Patriarchs, were
not bare Names of Honour, but had several Rights and Prerogatives
attending them. Thus the Metropolitans and Primates had, by their
Prerogative, a Right to ordain the Bishops of their respective Provinces,
to convene provincial Synods, and to have a general Superintendency
or Inspection over the whole Province. The ordaining
of Bishops was a Privilege common to the Metropolitan, with the
other Bishops of the same Province; but with this Difference, that
the Presence, or at least the Consent and Approbation of the Metropolitan
was absolutely necessary; for, according to the Fourth and
Sixth Canons of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, <i>He who was not ordained, or
approved, by the Metropolitan, was not to be a Bishop</i>. This Privilege
was confirmed to the Metropolitans by many subsequent Councils,
namely, by those of <i>Arles</i>, <i>Laodicea</i>, <i>Carthage</i>, <i>Chalcedon</i>,
<i>Ephesus</i><a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c015'><sup>[636]</sup></a>, and many others. However, in the Fifth Century, the
Patriarchs of <i>Alexandria</i> and <i>Constantinople</i> began, in the East, to
usurp this Prerogative, pretending, that no Bishops ought to be ordained
in their respective Dioceses, without their Knowlege, Consent,
and Approbation; and the Patriarch of <i>Rome</i>, still more ambitious
and encroaching, claimed a Right to ordain the Bishops throughout
all the Provinces of the West, which occasioned endless Disputes, as
we shall see in the Sequel of this History. As to the Second Privilege
peculiar to the Metropolitans, they had a Right to summon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Bishops of their respective Provinces to meet when they thought proper;
to appoint the Time and Place of their Meeting; to punish such
as did not, without just Cause, comply with their Summons; and to
preside in the Assembly. The general Care and Inspection, which
they were charged with over the whole Province, imported, First, That
all Complaints against, all Contests with or between the Bishops of the
Province, were to be brought to their Tribunal; and there heard,
judged, and determined, not by the Metropolitan alone, but by him
and the other Bishops of the Province, in a Provincial Synod. Innumerable
Instances might be alleged of Bishops thus deposed by their
Metropolitans. Secondly, The Metropolitans had a Right to receive
Appeals from the Sentence of inferior Bishops, and with the other
Bishops, to confirm or reverse their Decrees. And, lastly, each Metropolitan
was to keep a watchful Eye over the Bishops of his Province,
and take care that they discharged, as they ought, the Functions of
their Office. These Privileges were, in express Terms, granted to the
Metropolitans, by almost innumerable Councils, which it is needless,
and would be too tedious, to name.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Rights and Priv-<br/>ileges of Patriarchs,<br/>or Exarchs.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Patriarchs, or Exarchs; by their Prerogative, they were
impowered to ordain the Metropolitans, to convene Diocesan Synods,
and to have a general Superintendency over their respective Dioceses,
such as the Metropolitans had over their respective Provinces. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Bishop of</i> Rome<br/><i>not a Patriarch</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The
Bishop of <i>Rome</i> had not the Charge of a whole Diocese, and therefore
was not, properly speaking, Exarch or Patriarch: his Jurisdiction
did not extend beyond the Limits of the Vicarage of <i>Rome</i>, or the Suburbicarian
Provinces; and no Instance can be produced of Metropolitans
or Bishops ordained by him, out of those Provinces, till the
Time of <i>Valentinian</i> III. Even in the Vicarage of <i>Italy</i> the Metropolitans
of each Province ordained all the Bishops, and were themselves
ordained by the Bishops of the Province. But over the Suburbicarian
Provinces the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> exercised greater Power and Authority,
than the Exarchs of the East did over the Provinces of their
Dioceses; for the latter left the Ordination of the Bishops to their
Metropolitans, whereas the former ordained not only the Bishops of
the Metropolitan Cities, but all those of the fore-mentioned Provinces:
and the Reason of this was, because these Provinces had no
Metropolitans, to whom the Ordination of Bishops would of Right
have belonged; so that the Prerogatives of the Metropolitans were
all vested in the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> alone. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Bishops of</i> Rome<br/><i>have no Right to<br/>ordain the Metro-<br/>politans</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As there were no Exarchs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>or Patriarchs in the West, the Bishops of each Province were, by
several Councils, vested with the Power of ordaining their own Metropolitans;
and that they were thus ordained in <i>Gaul</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and
<i>West Africa</i>, is so manifest as to admit of no Dispute<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c015'><sup>[637]</sup></a>. And yet the
Sticklers for the See of <i>Rome</i> pretend the Bishops of that City to have a
divine and inherent Right of ordaining all the Metropolitans throughout
the Christian World, by themselves, their Vicars, or Delegates.
To maintain this chimerical Right against the uncontestable Evidence
of Facts, they tell us, that the Popes, for some Ages, neglected to exert
the Power they had<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c015'><sup>[638]</sup></a>. But from this Charge all Mankind will clear
them, it being but too well known, that they never neglected the
least Opportunity of exerting to the utmost the Power they had, and
usurping the Power they had not. But, Cavils aside, it is evident
beyond Dispute, that the Popes never knew, nor dreamt of, any such
Right or Prerogative, till they were told of it by their flattering Divines;
at least Pope <i>Leo</i>, surnamed <i>the Great</i>, did not; for in one
of his Letters to the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i> he disclaims, in express Terms,
the Right of ordaining the Bishops of that Diocese<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c015'><sup>[639]</sup></a>. To conclude,
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> was the only Metropolitan in that Vicarage; and,
as such, had a Right to ordain all the Bishops of the Suburbicarian
Provinces, or the Provinces subject to the Vicar of <i>Rome</i>; but, for
a considerable Tract of Time, there is no Instance of their ordaining
either Bishops or Metropolitans out of that District.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Title of</i> Arch-<br/>bishop <i>in itself a bare<br/>Name of Honour</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Title of Archbishop, it is in itself a bare Name of Honour;
whence, in some Countries, especially in <i>Italy</i>, several are
distinguished with that Title, who indeed take place of, but have no
Power or Authority over, other Bishops. And thus far of the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy, as settled in the Fourth and following Centuries,
of the different Degrees that compose it, and the Prerogatives peculiar
to each Degree, the Knowlege whereof is absolutely necessary
for the right understanding of the many Contests and Disputes in
point of Jurisdiction, which I shall have Occasion to touch upon in
the Sequel of this History; for it was not at once, but by Degrees,
and not without great Opposition, that the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, extending
their Authority beyond the Limits of that Vicarage, which
was at that time the Boundary of their Jurisdiction, acquired the
unlimited Power they now enjoy, with the arrogant Title of <i>Universal
Bishop</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Donation of all</i><br/>Italy <i>made by</i><br/>Constantine <i>to the<br/>Pope, a Forgery</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>But to return to <i>Sylvester</i>, in whose Pontificate this great Change
began; I need not employ many Words to shew the Forgery of the
so much boasted Donation of all <i>Italy</i>, supposed to have been made
by <i>Constantine</i> to <i>Sylvester</i>, in the Spring of the Year 324. Four Days
after he had been baptized by that Pontiff, since the Instrument of
that Donation is now looked upon as supposititious, by all who have
the least Tincture of Learning. The Arguments they allege against it
are: 1. That more than Twelve Copies of that Instrument are still
extant, all differing from one another. 2. That it evidently appears,
from Two Constitutions of <i>Constantine</i>, still to be seen in the <i>Theodosian</i>
Code<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c015'><sup>[640]</sup></a>, that he was not at <i>Rome</i>, but at <i>Thessalonica</i>, in the
Spring of the Year 324. 3. That neither <i>Eusebius</i>, who has given us
a very minute and particular Account of the Actions of that Prince,
nor any other contemporary Writer, has so much as hinted at so
memorable a Fact. 4. That all the antient Writers, both <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Latin</i>, agree, that <i>Constantine</i> was not baptized at <i>Rome</i>, but at
<i>Nicomedia</i>, when he lay at the Point of Death<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c015'><sup>[641]</sup></a>. Let those, who
stand up in Defence of that Donation, give satisfactory Answers to
these Reasons, and I shall conclude with them, that <i>Italy</i> being, by
such a Donation, disjoined from the Empire, the Emperors who succeeded
<i>Constantine</i>, had no Claim or Title to that Country; that
none of their Constitutions were binding there; and consequently
that, by the Inhabitants of <i>Italy</i>, Recourse ought to be had, in all
Cases, not to the Civil, but to the Canon Law: for such pernicious
Doctrines have been broached, published, and maintained, as natural
Deductions from <i>Constantine</i>’s great Generosity to <i>Sylvester</i><a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c015'><sup>[642]</sup></a>. In
<i>Rome</i> is still to be seen, in a most sumptuous Chapel, close to the
<i>Lateran</i>, the Baptistery or Font in which <i>Constantine</i> is said to have
been baptized. The Chapel is adorned with noble Paintings, representing
that august Ceremony, as performed by <i>Sylvester</i>, in the magnificent
Drapery, and stately Apparel, of the present Popes. Four
Days after this Ceremony, <i>Constantine</i>, sensible of his Obligations to
<i>Sylvester</i>, rewarded him for his Trouble with a Fee, as <i>Luchesini</i> the
<i>Scolopian</i> expresses it, answering in some Degree to the Greatness of
the Favour he had received at his Hands; a Fee worthy of so great a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Prince, of so great a Pope<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c015'><sup>[643]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantine <i>baptized<br/>at</i> Nicomedia, <i>and<br/>not at</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Fee, which that Writer, otherwise
a Man of Learning, makes a long and tedious Descant upon,
was no less than the City of <i>Rome</i>, and all <i>Italy</i>. That <i>Constantine</i>
was baptized at <i>Nicomedia</i>, and not at <i>Rome</i>, is affirmed, in express
Terms, by <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c015'><sup>[644]</sup></a>, <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c015'><sup>[645]</sup></a>, <i>Socrates</i><a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c015'><sup>[646]</sup></a>, and <i>Photius</i><a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c015'><sup>[647]</sup></a>, among
the <i>Greeks</i>; and, among the <i>Latins</i>, by St. <i>Ambrose</i><a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c015'><sup>[648]</sup></a>, St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c015'><sup>[649]</sup></a>,
and the Council of <i>Rimini</i><a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c015'><sup>[650]</sup></a>. <i>Emmanuel Schelstrat</i>, on one Side,
ashamed to reject, or even to question such Authorities, but, on the
other, unwilling to rob <i>Sylvester</i> of that Glory, will have <i>Constantine</i>
to have been baptized in both Places. It is well known, says
he, that <i>Constantine</i>, in the Latter-end of his Life, was greatly biassed
in favour of the <i>Arians</i>, and their Tenets. Now a Practice obtained
among them of rebaptizing such as came over to their Sect from
the Catholic Church; and, to conform to this Custom, <i>Constantine</i>
was, in all Likelihood, prevailed upon by <i>Eusebius</i>, the <i>Arian</i> Bishop
of <i>Nicomedia</i>, who assisted him on his Death-bed<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c015'><sup>[651]</sup></a>. Thus <i>Schelstrat</i>.
But it is certain, that, in <i>Constantine</i>’s Time, the <i>Arians</i> allowed the
Validity of Baptism administred by the Catholics; for, long after, we
find St. <i>Austin</i> upbraiding them with the Practice of rebaptizing, as a
Novelty lately introduced among them<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c015'><sup>[652]</sup></a>. Besides, who is so little
versed in the History of the Church, as not to know, that, in those
early Times, a very bad Custom universally prevailed, at least among
Persons of Distinction, who embraced the Christian Religion, namely,
that of putting off their Baptism to their Death-bed, or till they were
upon the Point of exposing themselves to some great Danger? Thus
<i>Theodosius the Great</i>, though he had not only openly professed the
Christian Religion, but given many Instances of an extraordinary
Piety, yet did not chuse to be baptized till he fell dangerously ill
at <i>Thessalonica</i><a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c015'><sup>[653]</sup></a>. In like manner <i>Valentinian</i> II delayed his Baptism
till the Approach of a Battle with the Barbarians, when he sent,
in great Haste, for St. <i>Ambrose</i> to administer that Sacrament to him.
But while the good Bishop was crossing the <i>Alps</i>, on his Way to
<i>Vienne</i>, where the Emperor then was, he received the melancholy
News of his having been inhumanly murdered by some of his own
Officers, at the Instigation of <i>Arbogastus</i>. His Death was greatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>lamented by St. <i>Ambrose</i>, who, in the elegant Oration, which he pronounced
on Occasion of his Obsequies, maintained, that the fervent
Desire of Baptism had the same Effect as the Sacrament itself; and
consequently, that the Sins of the deceased Prince being thereby cancelled,
it was not to be doubted, but from this Life he had passed
to eternal Bliss<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c015'><sup>[654]</sup></a>. Innumerable Instances of the same Nature occur
in History, which were, it seems, utterly unknown to the Author
of the Acts of Pope <i>Sylvester</i>, upon whose sole Authority the Fable
has been credited of <i>Constantine</i>’s receiving Baptism at the Hands of
<i>Sylvester</i>, soon after his Conversion. That Impostor, whoever he was,
is supposed to have lived in the Eighth Century, long after the Custom
of deferring Baptism to the Point of Death had been utterly abolished.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>What gave Count-<br/>enance to the Custom<br/>of deferring Baptism<br/>to the Point of Death.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What gave Countenance to such a Custom, was an Opinion
then generally received, and still held by the Church of <i>Rome</i>; <i>viz.</i>
That by the Waters of the sacred Font Men were washed clean, not
only from the original, but from all other Sins. This proved a great
Encouragement to Vice when Piety began (and it began but too
early) to decay among Christians; and therefore the Fathers of the
Church, especially <i>Basil</i>, his Brother <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Nyssa</i>, and St. <i>Ambrose</i><a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c015'><sup>[655]</sup></a>,
employed all the Oratory they were Masters of, in crying down such
a pernicious and wicked Custom, as they style it; so that it was at
last quite laid aside. Whether Confession ought not, on the same
Account, to be put down, I shall leave the Reader to judge; and only
observe here, by the way, that had the Virtue and Efficacy, ascribed
now to Confession, been known in those Times, Sinners needed not
have delayed Baptism to the Point of Death, since their Sins had
been no less effectually cancelled by Confession, than by Baptism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Spurious Pieces<br/>ascribed to</i> Sylvester.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Letter from the Council of <i>Nice</i> to <i>Sylvester</i>, his Answer,
the Acts of a Council of 275 Bishops, supposed to have been
held by him, at the Request of the Fathers of <i>Nice</i>, to confirm their
Canons and Decrees<a id='rN12' /><a href='#fN12' class='c015'><sup>[N12]</sup></a>, his Letter to the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, in favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of the Church of <i>Vienne</i>; the Acts of Two other Councils, said to
have been held by him at <i>Rome</i>; they are all Pieces universally
rejected by Men of Learning, and deemed no less fabulous than the
Instrument of <i>Constantine</i>’s Donation, and that Prince’s Journey with
<i>Sylvester</i> to the Council of <i>Nice</i>, as it is related in the Acts of the
latter, even in those which <i>F. Combesis</i> published in 1660. They are
in <i>Greek</i>, and that Writer undertakes to defend them as genuine<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c015'><sup>[656]</sup></a>;
but we need no other Proof than the Account they give of that Journey,
to conclude them incapable of being defended. <i>Sylvester</i> died on the
31st of <i>December</i> 335. after having governed the Church of <i>Rome</i> for
the Space of Twenty-one Years, and Eleven Months<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c015'><sup>[657]</sup></a>.</p>

<div>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN12'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN12'>N12</a>. The Style of the Letter from the
Council to <i>Sylvester</i> is quite barbarous and
unintelligible. It begins thus: <i>Gloriam
corroborata de Divinis Mysteriis. Ecclesiasticæ
utilitatis quæ ad robur pertinent Ecclesiæ
Catholicæ &amp; Apostolicæ ad sedem tuam</i>
Romanam <i>explanata &amp; de Græce redacta
scribere confitemur--Nunc itaque ad vestræ
sedis argumentum accurrimus roborari</i>. The
rest is written in the same Style; the Consuls
are called <i>Sovereigns</i>, and the Letter is
dated Five or Six Days after the Opening
of the Council. The Design of the Impostor
was, to make the Fathers of <i>Nice</i>
recur to <i>Sylvester</i> for a Confirmation of
their Decrees. <i>Sylvester</i>’s Answer is of a
piece with the Letter of the Council; it
supposes him to have added something to
the Council; mentions the Cycle of <i>Victorinus</i>,
who was not born in <i>Sylvester</i>’s
Time, nor many Years after; and bears a
false Date. As for the Council said, and
by some still maintained, to have been held
at <i>Rome</i>, to confirm the Canons of <i>Nice</i>, it
was utterly unknown to all the Antients.
And who can believe, that none of the Antients
should ever have heard of a Council
held in the Metropolis of the Empire, and
consisting, as we are told, of Two hundred
and Seventy-five Bishops, or, if they had
heard of it, that they would never have
mentioned it? Besides, it is said to have
been held at <i>Rome</i>, in the Presence of <i>Constantine</i>;
and it is certain, that the Emperor
was not in <i>Rome</i> at the Time the Council
is supposed to have been held. The Canons,
which are supposed to have been made
on this Occasion, contain Regulations repugnant
to the Practice of those Times, and
which it was then impossible to observe.
The first Canon relates to the Time when
<i>Easter</i> was to be kept; but what is there
determined no Man can know. The Second
is no less unintelligible than the First:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ut unusquisque Episcopus rediens ad Parochiam
suam Compaginem Salutationis plebi
tuæ innotescat</i></span>. These are the Words of
this Canon. The Third forbids the Ecclesiastics
to appear before secular Judges, let
the Action be what it will; which is repugnant
to the Discipline of those Times. The
Fourth will have those, who enter themselves
among the Clergy, to pass through
all the Degrees, and fixes the Time which
they are to continue in each Degree. They
are to be Janitors or Door-keepers one Year,
Lectors or Readers Twenty, Exorcists
Ten, Acolytes Five, Subdeacons Five,
Deacons Five, and Priests Six; so that none
under Threescore could attain to the Episcopal
Dignity; which is highly absurd in
itself, and contrary to the Practice of those
Times.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'>Upon the Death of <i>Mark</i> the See was vacant for the Space of
Four Months, that is, to the 6th of <i>February</i> 337. when <i>Julius</i>

Sixteen Bishops in the <i>December</i> of the same Year<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c015'><sup>[672]</sup></a>. But the Date of
this Council puts <i>Baronius</i> to a Stand; for in the Date are marked the
Consuls, the Year of the Emperors, and the Indiction. Now, according
to the Consuls, it must have been held in 337. according to
the Year of the Emperors, in 340. and, according to the Indiction, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>347. The Annalist spares neither his Words nor his Labour to solve,
or rather to patch up, this Difficulty; but, being sensible, after a long,
tedious, and puzzling Descant, that he labours in vain, he concludes,
that the Text has been altered<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c015'><sup>[673]</sup></a>. He might have saved himself a great
deal of Trouble, by owning at once what has been plainly proved
since by <i>Blondel</i><a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c015'><sup>[674]</sup></a>, <i>viz.</i> that no such Council was ever held.</p>

<p class='c001'>When <i>Julius</i> was raised to the Pontificate, the celebrated <i>Athanasius</i>,
Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, lived in Banishment at <i>Treves</i>; but the
Year following he was allowed to return to his Church by the Three
Emperors, <i>Constantine</i>, <i>Constantius</i>, and <i>Constans</i>, who had succeeded
their Father in 337. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Arians <i>write to</i><br/>Julius <i>against</i> Athan-<br/>asius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The <i>Eusebians</i>, that is, the <i>Arian</i> Faction
headed by <i>Eusebius</i> Bishop of <i>Nicomedia</i>, at whose Instigation he had
been banished by <i>Constantine</i>, alarmed at his Return, writ bitter
Letters against him to the Three Princes, and likewise to the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>. To the latter they dispatched with their Letters <i>Macarius</i> a
Presbyter, and the Two Deacons <i>Martyrius</i> and <i>Hesychius</i>. <i>Athanasius</i>
no sooner heard of this Embassy than he, in his Turn, dispatched
some Presbyters to oppose the Attempts of his Enemies, and defend
his Innocence against the Calumnies, which he well knew they were
sent to spread against him, not only at <i>Rome</i>, but all over the West<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c015'><sup>[675]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They desire</i> Julius<br/><i>to assemble a Council</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Upon their Arrival, <i>Macarius</i> privately withdrew from <i>Rome</i>, and
the other Two were so confounded by the Deputies of <i>Athanasius</i>, at
a private Conference held before the Pope, that, to gain Time, they
had no other Resource but to appeal to a Council, which they begged
the Pope to assemble, and to give timely notice thereof both to <i>Athanasius</i>
and the <i>Eusebians</i>. They bragged that, before the Council,
they would make good the Charge they had brought against <i>Athanasius</i>,
and offered to take <i>Julius</i> himself for their Judge<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c015'><sup>[676]</sup></a>. This Offer,
we may be sure, was readily accepted by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who
immediately writ to <i>Athanasius</i> inviting him to the Council, and at
the same time desired the Deputies of the <i>Eusebians</i> to acquaint their
Party, that, agreeably to their Request, a Council should be soon convened.
<i>Athanasius</i>, upon the Receipt of the Pope’s Letter, set out,
without Delay, for <i>Rome</i>, where he arrived in the Latter end of the
Year 339. After his Arrival the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> dispatched <i>Elpidius</i>
and <i>Philoxenes</i>, Two of his Presbyters, with Letters to the <i>Eusebians</i>,
summoning them to the Council, which their Deputies had demanded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and acquainting them with the Time and Place in which it was to
be held<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c015'><sup>[677]</sup></a>. The Place was <i>Rome</i>, and the Time the Month of <i>June</i>
341. according to the most probable Opinion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They decline appear-<br/>ing at the Council of</i><br/>Rome; <i>assemble one<br/>at</i> Antioch; <i>and there<br/>depose</i> Athanasius;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The other Bishops
assembled at the Time appointed; but the <i>Eusebians</i>, instead of
appearing at the Council of <i>Rome</i>, which had been convened at their
Request, assembled one at <i>Antioch</i>, and there, without waiting for
the Determination of <i>Julius</i>, whom they had chosen for their Judge,
deposed <i>Athanasius</i>, and appointed <i>Gregory</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>
in his room; nay, they even detained the Deputies sent by the Pope
till the Time appointed for the Meeting of the Council was expired,
that they might afterwards plead, as they did, the Shortness of the
Term prescribed for them to meet in<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c015'><sup>[678]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who is declared<br/>innocent in the<br/>Council of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In the Council of <i>Rome</i> the
Cause of <i>Athanasius</i> was examined, and he, after the strictest Scrutiny,
declared innocent with one Voice by the Fifty Bishops who composed
it<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c015'><sup>[679]</sup></a>; so that <i>Julius</i> and the rest continued to communicate with him
as a Bishop<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c015'><sup>[680]</sup></a>, which was declaring him unlawfully deposed. Several
other Bishops, who had been deposed by the <i>Arians</i>, came to lay their
Complaints before the Council, and, among the rest, <i>Marcellus</i>
Bishop of <i>Ancyra</i>, and <i>Paul</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>. The former had
been condemned as an Heretic by a Council held at <i>Constantinople</i> in
336. and consisting intirely of <i>Arian</i> Bishops. As nobody appeared
against him during the Fifteen Months he continued at <i>Rome</i>, and
the Declaration of his Faith, which, at the Request of <i>Julius</i>, he
gave under his own Hand, was judged quite orthodox by the Pope and
the Council, he was readmitted to the Communion of the Catholic
Church<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c015'><sup>[681]</sup></a>. But whether they did not judge too favourably of his Belief,
may be very much questioned: <i>Epiphanius</i> at least was no-ways
satisfied with it<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c015'><sup>[682]</sup></a>. And truly it would be no easy Task to clear him
from the Heresy of <i>Sabellius</i> and <i>Samosatenus</i>, denying the Trinity of
the Divine Persons<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c015'><sup>[683]</sup></a>: but to examine so perplexed and intricate a
Point, would be foreign to my Purpose.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Neither</i> Athanasius<br/><i>nor any other<br/>Bishop restored by</i><br/>Julius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Socrates</i><a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c015'><sup>[684]</sup></a> and <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c015'><sup>[685]</sup></a>
write, that <i>Julius</i>, by the Authority of his See, reinstated all the
Bishops who had been displaced by the <i>Arians</i>; that he supported and
defended their Innocence with Letters full of Vigour and Liberty;
severely reprimanded those who had deposed them; summoned some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of them to appear at <i>Rome</i>, in a limited Time, to justify their Conduct;
and, lastly, that he threatened to treat them as they deserved,
if they did not forbear raising Disturbances in the Church. In virtue
of these Letters, says <i>Socrates</i>, the Bishops were restored to their Sees.
But <i>Sozomen</i> names only <i>Athanasius</i>, and <i>Paul</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>.
It is surprising, that the Advocates for the See of <i>Rome</i> should
allege the Testimony of these two Writers, to prove that the Authority
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> was acknowleged by the Orientals; that his Jurisdiction
was universal; when they themselves must know (for I cannot
suppose them so ignorant as not to know) that the Historians whom
they quote were grosly mistaken. For it is manifest from <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c015'><sup>[686]</sup></a>,
that <i>Julius</i> writ only two Letters to the <i>Eusebians</i>; one before the
Council met, inviting them to it; and the other, while the Council
was still sitting, which I shall speak of hereafter; and in neither of
these does <i>Julius</i> take upon him either to threaten or command. The
above-mentioned Historians seem to have jumbled these two Letters
together, and to have made a Third out of them, with some Improvements
of their own. As to his restoring the deposed Bishops to their
Sees, it is certain he did not, since <i>Athanasius</i> continued in the West
till the Year 349. when he was restored by the Council of <i>Sardica</i>.
<i>Paul</i> indeed was reinstated sooner, but not till the See of <i>Constantinople</i>
became vacant by the Death of <i>Eusebius</i>, who had been translated
from <i>Nicomedia</i> to that City. I appeal to the <i>Roman</i> Catholics
themselves, and leave them to judge whether it is at all probable, that
the Emperor <i>Constantius</i>, and the Oriental Bishops, incensed as they
were against <i>Paul</i> and <i>Athanasius</i>, whom they had condemned and
deposed in Two Synods, should, out of Respect to the Pope, suffer
them thus tamely to return to their Sees, and drive out those whom
they had placed in their room. This had been owning themselves
guilty, and reversing the Sentence they had but lately pronounced,
which, as will appear, they were no-ways in an Humour to do.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Eusebians <i>write<br/>to</i> Julius;</div>

<p class='c001'>While the Council of <i>Rome</i> was yet sitting, the Pope’s two Deputies,
<i>Elpidius</i> and <i>Philoxenes</i>, returning from the East, delivered to
<i>Julius</i> a Letter from the <i>Eusebians</i>, which may pass for a Master-piece
of the Kind; for, without departing from, or intrenching upon, the
Respect that was due to the Bishop of the Imperial City, they, at the
same time, commend, censure, menace, and rally him in a most cruel
Manner. They begin with alleging several frivolous Excuses for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>not appearing at the Council, such as the <i>Persian</i> War, which, by
the way, did not prevent their assembling at <i>Antioch</i>; the Shortness
of the Term prescribed for their Meeting; the Pope’s writing only to
some of them, and not to all, as he ought to have done; and finally,
his writing to them in his own Name alone, which was tacitly taxing
him with taking too much upon him. They then launch out
ironically, it seems, into the highest Encomiums on the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, styling her the first of all Churches, the School of the Apostles,
the Metropolis of true Piety. However, the first Preachers of the Gospel,
add they, came out of the East; and, after all, we ought to be
looked upon as Inferiors to none, though perhaps we may not have
such numerous and flourishing Churches as some have, since the
want of Numbers may be abundantly supplied by the Piety of a few.
As to Rank, we are all equal, the Greatness of the Cities, in which
we preside, adding nothing to the Dignity we all enjoy. In the next
place, they express great Concern at the little Regard shewn by some
to the Decisions of Councils, which ought to be revered by all, and
deemed immutable. This was modestly censuring the Pope for not
acquiescing to the Decrees of the Councils of <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Constantinople</i>
condemning <i>Athanasius</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and threaten to<br/>separate themselves<br/>from his Communion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In the End they allege several Things
both against <i>Athanasius</i>, and <i>Marcellus</i> Bishop of <i>Ancyra</i>; and conclude
with telling <i>Julius</i>, that if he renounced all Correspondence
and Intercourse with the Bishops they had deposed, and acknowleged
those they had placed in their room, they would continue to communicate
with him; but if he refused to comply with their Decisions and
Decrees, they should think themselves obliged to act in a very different
Manner<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c015'><sup>[687]</sup></a>. <i>Julius</i> was so mortified with this Letter, that he suppressed
it for some time, hoping the <i>Eusebians</i> would send Deputies, who,
he presumed, would express their Sentiments by Word of Mouth, and
in a different Style. But, none appearing, he was obliged to lay the
Letter he had received before the Fathers of the Council, who, after
expressing the greatest Indignation against the <i>Eusebians</i>, advised the
Pope to answer it; which he did accordingly, by that excellent Letter,
which has been preserved intire among the Works of <i>Athanasius</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Julius<i>’s Answer<br/> to their Letter</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He begins with complaining, in very modest Terms, of the Animosity
they betrayed in their Letter, to which he thought he had given no
Occasion; unless they had taken it amiss, that he had summoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>them to the Council; which he could not persuade himself they did,
since, at the Request of their Deputies, he had appointed the Council
to meet, and, at their Request, invited them to it. As for the Regard
due to the Decrees and Decisions of Councils, he told them, that
they had trespassed the first against the Decrees of the Oecumenical
Council of <i>Nice</i>, by admitting the <i>Arians</i> to their Communion, which
he conceived to be more criminal in them, than it was in him to
receive <i>Athanasius</i> and <i>Marcellus</i>. He reproaches them with another
Transgression of the Canons of the Church, namely with that of passing
from one Bishoprick to another, which <i>Eusebius</i> had done. He
then justifies his Conduct with regard to <i>Athanasius</i> and <i>Marcellus</i>;
exhorts the <i>Eusebians</i>, with great Zeal and Earnestness, to find out
some Remedy against the Evils and Disorders that reigned in the East,
which he describes at Length; and concludes with complaining of the
Orientals for condemning and deposing Bishops, those especially of
the Apostolic Sees, without the Concurrence or Knowlege of their
Brethren in the West<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c015'><sup>[688]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Julius</i>, finding his Letter made no Impression on the <i>Eusebians</i>, applied
with several other Bishops to the Emperor <i>Constans</i>, who, at
their Request proposed to his Brother <i>Constantius</i> the assembling of
an Oecumenical Council, in order to put an End to those unhappy
Divisions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council of</i><br/>Sardica.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  To this Proposal <i>Constantius</i> agreed; and accordingly, by
the Command of the two Princes, a numerous Council met in 347. at
<i>Sardica</i>, the Metropolis of <i>Dacia</i> in <i>Illyricum</i><a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c015'><sup>[689]</sup></a>. <i>Julius</i>, apprehending
it dangerous to abandon his Flock at that Juncture, did not assist
in Person, but by his Deputies <i>Archidamus</i> and <i>Philoxenes</i>, who
signed in his Name<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c015'><sup>[690]</sup></a>. The Orientals came, but withdrew soon after,
upon the Council’s refusing to exclude <i>Athanasius</i>, and some others,
whom they had condemned<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c015'><sup>[691]</sup></a>. But by the orthodox Bishops, who
remained, the Acts of the Council of <i>Rome</i> were confirmed, <i>Athanasius</i>
and Three other Bishops declared innocent; and those, who had been
placed in their room, not only deposed, but anathematized, and intirely
cut off from the Communion of the Catholic Church<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c015'><sup>[692]</sup></a>. The
Council, before they broke up, writ several Letters; and, among the
rest, one to the Emperors; one to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>; and a circular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Letter to all the Bishops of the Catholic Church, acquainting
them with what had passed, and exhorting them to join the Council,
and declare to the World, that they accepted their Decrees by subscribing
to them<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c015'><sup>[693]</sup></a>. The circular Letter was subscribed first by the great
<i>Osius</i> Bishop of <i>Cordoua</i>, and in the Second place by the Pope’s Legates<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c015'><sup>[694]</sup></a>.
In their Letter to <i>Julius</i> they beg him to notify their Decrees
to the Bishops of <i>Sardinia</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, and <i>Italy</i>, lest any of them should
receive Letters of Peace and Communion from the Bishops they had
condemned<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c015'><sup>[695]</sup></a>. In this Letter the Council says, or rather is made to
say, That <i>it is very meet or reasonable, that all Bishops should acquaint
their Head, that is, the See of St.</i> Peter, <i>with what passes in their
respective Provinces</i><a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c015'><sup>[696]</sup></a>. I agree with <i>Blondel</i><a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c015'><sup>[697]</sup></a>, that this Passage is
foisted in; but cannot acquiesce to the only Reason he alleges to support
his Opinion, <i>viz.</i> the Barbarity of the <i>Latin</i> Expression (<i>valde
congruentissimum est</i>); for such a Slip might easily escape Men wholly
bent on defending the Truth, and speaking it; and besides, we are
not certain, that this Letter was originally written in <i>Latin</i>. The
want of Connexion between that Sentence, and what is said both
before and after it, is, I think, a more convincing Proof of Forgery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Canons of the Council<br/>of</i> Sardica <i>relating to<br/>the Bishop of</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>By the Council of <i>Sardica</i> several Canons were made; but I shall
only take notice of those that regard the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. By the
Third Canon in the <i>Greek</i>, or the Fourth in the <i>Latin</i> Translation
by <i>Isidorus</i>, it is ordered, that if any Bishop shall think himself unjustly
condemned, his Judges shall acquaint the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> therewith,
who may either confirm the first Judgment, or order his Cause
to be re-examined by such of the neighbouring Bishops as <a id='corr121.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='she'>he</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_121.26'><ins class='correction' title='she'>he</ins></a></span> shall
think fit to name<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c015'><sup>[698]</sup></a>. <i>Osius</i>, who was greatly addicted to the See of
<i>Rome</i>, begged the Council to grant this Honour to the Memory of
St. <i>Peter</i>. The Fourth Canon, according to the <i>Greek</i>, adds, That
the See of the deposed Bishop shall remain vacant till his Cause shall be
judged by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. By the Fifth Canon, which by some
Mistake is the Seventh in <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i>, it is ordered, that if a
Bishop, condemned in his own Province, shall chuse to be judged by
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and desires him to appoint some of his Presbyters
to judge him in his Name, together with the Bishops, the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i> may grant him his Request. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Practice of ap-<br/>pealing to the Pope<br/>first introduced.</i><br/><br/><i>Several Circumstances<br/>concur in his Favour.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Thus was the pernicious Practice
of appealing to the Pope first introduced and authorized. It must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>observed, that the Oriental Bishops had all left the Council: those
who remained were all zealous Opposers of <i>Arianism</i>. At the Head
of their Party was the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. In the Heat of their Zeal they
thought they could not confer too much Power upon him; and so
made a Concession intirely repugnant to the Discipline of the primitive
Church, and which he could never have obtained, had not those Dispositions
worked strongly in his Favour. This will not be surprising to
those, who have attended to History, and seen how much the Ambition
of Princes, and Heads of Factions, is often advanced beyond its
due Bounds by the indiscreet Fervour of Party-Zeal. To the Council
of <i>Sardica</i>, acting under this Influence, the See of <i>Rome</i> is indebted
for the so much boasted Privilege of receiving Appeals; and <i>Julius</i>
was very thankful for it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Popes claim<br/>as their original<br/>Right, what was<br/>granted them as a<br/>Favour.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But his Successors, looking upon such an
Obligation as a Diminution of their pretended Sovereignty, have had
the Assurance to claim it as their original Right: but that such a Right
was unknown to their great Friend <i>Osius</i>, to the Fathers of the Council,
nay, and to the Pope himself, and his Legates, is manifest, since
what they now claim as their original and inherent Right, was by
<i>Osius</i> begged of the Council as a Favour, and, as such, granted by
the Council, and accepted by the Pope and his Legates. This Power
of receiving Appeals, only with respect to the judging and deposing
of Bishops, has been extended by the Popes to all Causes; and great
Encouragement has been given to such as recurred to their Tribunal
on the slightest Occasions. <i>Concerning Appeals in the smallest Causes,
we would have you to know, that the same Regard is to be had to
them, for how slight a Matter soever they be made, as if they were
for a greater</i>, says Pope <i>Alexander</i> III. in his Letter to the Bishop of
<i>Worcester</i><a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c015'><sup>[699]</sup></a>. The scandalous and intolerable Abuse of this Power in
the Popes has obliged several Princes, even when Superstition most
prevailed, to restrain their Subjects by severe Laws from recurring to
<i>Rome</i>. Nay, other Councils of far greater Authority than that of
<i>Sardica</i>, finding no other Means to put a Stop to the daily Encroachments
of the See of <i>Rome</i>, have thought it necessary to revoke the
Privilege, which that Council had too rashly granted, as we shall see
in the Sequel of the present History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Decrees of the<br/>Council of</i> Antioch<br/><i>revoked by the<br/>Council of</i> Sardica.</div>

<p class='c001'>It had been decreed but Six Years before, by the Council of <i>Antioch</i>,
that, if the Bishops of the same Province disagreed in judging one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>their Brethren, the Metropolitan might call in those of the neighbouring
Province to judge with them; but if they agreed, and were unanimous
either in condemning or absolving, their Judgment should be
irreversible. Both these Decrees were revoked by the present Council,
though intirely agreeable to the antient Practice and Discipline of the
Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Pope has no<br/>Power to summon<br/>Bishops to</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But yet this Council, however favourable to the Pope, did
not grant him the Power of summoning Bishops to <i>Rome</i>, in order
to be judged there by him. He was only impowered to examine the
Judgment given in the Province; and, in case he found it to be wrong,
to order another in the same Province, to invite to this new Synod the
Bishops of the next Province, and to send his Legates to it as he thought
fit.</p>

first in the Subscriptions, as they have been transmitted to us by <i>Athanasius</i>,
who assures us, that <i>Osius</i> was the Chief, and presided in all
the Councils at which he assisted. He signed the first, and in his own
Name: after him signed the Legates, not in their own, but in the
Pope’s Name; <i>Julius Romæ per Archidamum &amp; Philoxenum Presbyteros</i>;
which is a sufficient Confutation of <i>De Marca</i>, and the
other Popish Writers, pretending, without the least Foundation, that
<i>Osius</i> presided in the Name of <i>Julius</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i><br/>Sardica <i>a Council of<br/>no great Authority</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It is to be observed, that the Canons of this Council were never
received in the East, nor even in the West by the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>;
and that they were not inserted by the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i> into the
Code of Canons approved by them, as Rules to be universally observed:
so that, after all, the so much boasted Council of <i>Sardica</i> is a
Council of no great Authority. Of this the Popes themselves were
well apprised; and therefore, recurring to Fraud, attempted, as we
shall see hereafter, to impose upon the World the Canons of <i>Sardica</i>
as the Canons of <i>Nice</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Athanasius</i>, though declared innocent by the Council, did not

had prevailed upon the Emperor <i>Constantius</i> to issue an Order,

him to Death, without further Tryal, in what Place soever he should

was threatened by his Brother, if he did not<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c015'><sup>[704]</sup></a>. Before his Departure
for the East he went to <i>Rome</i>, to take his Leave of that Church, and
his great Protector <i>Julius</i>, who, on that Occasion, writ an excellent
Letter of Congratulation to the Presbyters, Deacons, and People of
<i>Alexandria</i>. Of this Letter we have Two Copies, the one in <i>Socrates</i><a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c015'><sup>[705]</sup></a>,
and the other in <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c015'><sup>[706]</sup></a>. The former contains great

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Julius <i>was not<br/>banished by</i><br/>Constantius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But that Historian was
certainly mistaken, since <i>Constantius</i> was never Master of <i>Rome</i> in

and all the orthodox Bishops. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spurious Pieces<br/>ascribed to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Of the many Writings ascribed to
<i>Julius</i>, none, except his Two Letters, are authentic, the one to the
<i>Eusebians</i>, and the other to the Church of <i>Alexandria</i>, of which we
have spoken above. <i>Leontius</i> of <i>Byzantium</i> mentions Seven Epistles,
which, in the Latter-end of the Sixth Century, were ascribed to <i>Julius</i><a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c015'><sup>[712]</sup></a>;
but, at the same time, he assures us, that they were not written
by him, but by <i>Apollinaris</i> the Heresiarch; and the Monks of <i>Palæstine</i>,
in the Account they gave of the <i>Eutychians</i>, in the Time
of the Emperor <i>Anastasius</i>, assure us, that they seduced great Numbers
of People, by ascribing the Works of <i>Apollinaris</i> to the Fathers,
namely to <i>Athanasius</i>, to <i>Gregory Nazienzen</i>, and to <i>Julius</i><a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c015'><sup>[713]</sup></a>.
<i>Gennadius</i> ascribes to <i>Julius</i> a Letter to <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of
<i>Corinth</i>, greatly favouring of the Heresy of <i>Eutyches</i> and <i>Timotheus</i><a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c015'><sup>[714]</sup></a>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>but <i>Leontius</i> of <i>Byzantium</i> evidently proves that Letter to
have been written by <i>Apollinaris</i>; and as his it is quoted by his Two
Disciples <i>Valentine</i> and <i>Timotheus</i><a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c015'><sup>[715]</sup></a>. The Orientals have a Liturgy,
which they suppose to have been composed by <i>Julius</i>: this Supposition,
however groundless, shews him to have been in great Repute

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN13'>N13</a>. <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i> first abjured, or
rather pretended to abjure, their Errors at
<i>Milan</i>, before the Council, that at this
Time was sitting there. From <i>Milan</i> they
repaired to <i>Rome</i>, and there abjured anew
their Errors, in the Presence of <i>Julius</i>, and
the whole <i>Roman</i> Church. Here <i>Baronius</i>
observes, <i>that as this was a Matter of too
great Moment to be finally decided by the
Council of</i> Milan, <i>though the</i> Roman <i>Presbyters
were present, they sent them to</i> Julius,
<i>that they might abjure their Errors in his
Presence, agreeably to the antient Custom of
the Catholic Church</i>; viz. <i>that eminent Heretics
should abjure their Heresies only at</i>
Rome<a id='rN13.1' /><a href='#fN13.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. But, in the first Place, they
were not sent by the Council; but went to
<i>Rome</i> of their own Accord, as <i>Osius</i> assures
us, in express Terms, <i>Illi ultre Romam
venerunt</i><a id='rN13.2' /><a href='#fN13.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. In the second Place, the
Matter was finally determined by the
Council of <i>Milan</i>; for the Council received
their Recantation, and restored them
to the Communion of the Church. And
what else was to be done? what else could
<i>Julius</i> do? But if the Matter was finally
determined by the Council, what could induce
them, says <i>Baronius</i>, to travel to
<i>Rome</i>, and abjure anew their Heresy there?
The Answer is obvious: They had imposed
upon the Council by a pretended Abjuration,
and went to <i>Rome</i> to impose, in like
manner, on <i>Julius</i>, and obtain by that
means his Communion; which they did
accordingly, notwithstanding his <i>Infallibility</i>.
Besides, as both <i>Athanasius</i> and his
Enemies had referred their Cause to the
Arbitration of <i>Julius</i>, he was the fittest
Person to receive the Retraction of the
false Evidence, which they had formerly
given. As to the Custom, mentioned by
<i>Baronius</i>, that <i>eminent Heretics should abjure
their Heresies only at</i> Rome, no Man
can be so little versed in Ecclesiastical History
as not to know, that no such Custom
ever obtained in the Catholic Church. Not
to recur to more antient Times, the <i>Arian</i>
Bishops, that is, Bishops guilty of the same
Heresy as <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>, abjured their
Errors before the Council that was held at
<i>Jerusalem</i> in 335. There they renounced
their Heresy; there they were all restored
to the Communion of the Church, without
going, or offering to go, to <i>Rome</i>. And
many of those Bishops were surely more
eminent Heretics than either <i>Ursacius</i> or
<i>Valens</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Liberius</i> was chosen on the 22d of <i>May</i> 352. in the room of
<i>Julius</i><a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c015'><sup>[717]</sup></a>. He had trampled under-foot (to use his own Terms)
all worldly things, to observe the Gospel, and obey the Dictates of
his Faith. He had been employed, before his Election, in several
Ecclesiastical Ministries, and discharged them with Reputation, though
he was not conscious to himself of having ever done the least Thing
for the sake of Praise and Glory. He was at last raised to the Episcopal
Dignity, but much against his Will, as he calls God and the
Church to witness. He protests, that it was his ardent and only Wish,
that he might keep himself pure and undefiled in the Administration
of his new Dignity, that he might inviolably maintain and defend
the Faith, which he had received from his illustrious Predecessors,
among whom were many Martyrs<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c015'><sup>[718]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>No easy Matter to<br/>form a true Idea of<br/>his Character.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Were we to judge of his Conduct
from his Words, we should equal him to the best of his Predecessors;
but there appears, throughout his whole Administration,
such an odd Mixture of opposite Qualities, that it is no easy Matter
to form a true Idea of his Character: at one time we shall find him
bold, intrepid, and inflexible; at another timorous, faint-hearted, and
compliant; insomuch that one can hardly conceive him to be the
same Man. The latter Qualities he betrayed in the very Beginning of
his Pontificate, by separating himself from the Communion of <i>Athanasius</i>.
<i>Constans</i>, the great Support of the Orthodox Party, being
murdered, and <i>Constantius</i> upon the Point of becoming Master of
<i>Rome</i>, by a complete Victory he had gained over the Two Brothers
<i>Magnentius</i> and <i>Decentius</i>, the <i>Eusebians</i> thought this a proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Juncture to try whether the Fear of that Prince had not rendered
<i>Julius</i> somewhat more tractable. For <i>Constantius</i> was more incensed
than ever against <i>Athanasius</i>, being assured by the <i>Eusebians</i>, to
whom he gave an intire Credit, that he had influenced his Brother
to threaten him with a Civil War<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c015'><sup>[719]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Eusebians <i>write<br/>a second Letter to</i><br/>Julius <i>against</i><br/>Athanasius:<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They writ therefore to <i>Julius</i>
a second Letter, filled with new Complaints and Calumnies
against <i>Athanasius</i>; but <i>Julius</i> dying in the mean time, their Letter,
together with another to the same Purpose from the <i>Arians</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>,
was delivered to <i>Liberius</i>, who caused them both to be
publicly read in a full Assembly of the People, and in the Council,
which was then sitting at <i>Rome</i><a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c015'><sup>[720]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which is answered<br/>by</i> Liberius:<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His Answer to these Letters has not reached our Times; but a Copy of the Letter, which he writ
on that Occasion to <i>Athanasius</i>, has, to his eternal Disgrace, been
transmitted to us, among the Fragments of <i>Hilarius</i> Bishop of <i>Poitiers</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who summons</i><br/>Athanasius <i>to</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In that Letter he summons him to appear forthwith at <i>Rome</i>,
to clear himself there of the heavy Accusations brought against him;
and threatens to cut him off from the Communion of that Church,
if he refused to comply with the Summons<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c015'><sup>[721]</sup></a>. With this Letter he
dispatched Three of his Presbyters, <i>Lucius</i>, <i>Paulus</i>, and <i>Ælianus</i>;
strictly injoining them, by all means, to prevail upon <i>Athanasius</i> to
repair, without Delay, to <i>Rome</i><a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c015'><sup>[722]</sup></a>. This Conduct, so very different
from that of his Predecessor, was, no doubt, owing to the Dread he
was in of the Emperor <i>Constantius</i>, by this Time probably Master
of <i>Rome</i>, and all <i>Italy</i>; for what else could tempt or induce him
to act so preposterously? Be that as it will, <i>Athanasius</i> was greatly
surprised and concerned to find himself so unworthily treated and
threatened by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>; but did not think himself, on
that Account, obliged to abandon his Flock. He remained therefore
in <i>Alexandria</i>; but begged his Collegues in <i>Egypt</i> to write in his
Favour to the Pope; which they did accordingly. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Liberius <i>commun-<br/>icates with the</i> Arians,<br/><i>and excommunicates</i><br/>Athanasius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Liberius</i> wanted
to ingratiate himself with the <i>Arians</i>, and, by their means, with
the Emperor; and therefore, without any Regard to the Testimony
of the Orthodox Bishops, or the known Innocence of the oppressed
<i>Athanasius</i>, he writ to the <i>Eusebians</i>, acquainting them, that he
communicated with them; but, as to <i>Athanasius</i>, he had cut him off
from his Communion, and from that of his Church<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c015'><sup>[723]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Letter to them<br/>not supposititious.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Baronius</i><a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c015'><sup>[724]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and after him the <i>Benedictines</i>, in their last Edition of the Works of
<i>Hilarius</i> and <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c015'><sup>[725]</sup></a>, maintain this Letter of <i>Liberius</i> to have
been forged by the <i>Arians</i>, and inserted into the Works of <i>Hilarius</i>.
But they allege no convincing Reason why the other Pieces,
among which it has been conveyed to us, should be admitted as genuine,
and this alone rejected as supposititious. <i>Athanasius</i>, indeed,
never reproached the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> with his scandalous Conduct,
as they observe; but may not that be ascribed to his Moderation?
The more, as he was sensible, that <i>Liberius</i> acted thus not out of Ill-will,
but Fear. As to the want of Connexion between that Letter and
the Pieces preceding and following it, I should not have expected such
an Objection from any who had ever perused the Fragments of that
Writer, which every one knows to have been patched together without
any Regard to Time or Order<a id='rN14' /><a href='#fN14' class='c015'><sup>[N14]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN14'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN14'>N14</a>. Thus the very Letter of <i>Liberius</i> is
put in the Place where the Letter of the
Council of <i>Sardica</i> to the Emperor <i>Constantius</i>
ought to have been, as is manifest
from what is said immediately before it. A
few Lines after, instead of the Letter from
the Council of <i>Egypt</i> to <i>Liberius</i>, which
<i>Hilarius</i> promises, we find one from <i>Liberius</i>
to the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, written after
the Death of <i>Constantius</i> upon a quite different
Subject. What comes immediately
after the Letter of <i>Liberius</i> to the <i>Eusebians</i>,
ought, in all Likelihood, to have been
placed after the above-mentioned Letter of
the Council of <i>Sardica</i> to <i>Constantius</i>: for
to me it appears no less improbable than it
does or can do to <i>Baronius</i><a id='rN14.1' /><a href='#fN14.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, that <i>Hilarius</i>,
a most zealous Stickler for the Orthodox
Faith, should approve of the Pope’s
scandalous Letter, tending utterly to subvert
it, and express his Approbation in these
Terms; <i>What is there in this Letter that is
not holy? What is there that does not proceed
from the Fear of God?</i> However, I
cannot conclude, and much less demonstratively,
with the Annalist, that the Letter
has been forged by the <i>Arians</i>. All I
think can be inferred from thence is, that
the Letters, like most other Pieces there,
have been misplaced; and that the above-mentioned
Words of <i>Hilarius</i> ought to be
put after the Letter of the Council to <i>Constantius</i>,
and not after that of <i>Liberius</i> to
the <i>Arians</i>.</p>

whole Empire by the Death of <i>Magnentius</i>, who, after his Defeat,
had laid violent Hands on himself, summoned a Council to meet at

Legates, <i>Vincentius</i> Bishop of <i>Capua</i>, and <i>Marcellus</i> Bishop of <i>Campania</i>,
who, together with some others, had been sent by <i>Liberius</i>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>an intire Confidence in him, not doubting but he would maintain
the Dignity of his Legation, and support the Innocency of <i>Athanasius</i>
with that Firmness which he had shewn on several other Occasions

<p class='c001'>As the Council consisted chiefly of <i>Arians</i>, their great Point in

of <i>Athanasius</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Emperor’s Edict.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This therefore was in the first place proposed in the

Firmness and Constancy of <i>Vincentius</i> were not Proof against such a
Trial. He did all that lay in his Power to divert the Emperor from
the Execution of a Decree utterly inconsistent with the Liberty of a
Council; but finding him deaf to all Remonstrances, he began to
capitulate, offering to sign the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>, on condition
the <i>Eusebians</i> signed that of <i>Arius</i>, and publicly abjured his
Doctrine. This he thought would be some Alleviation of his Guilt,
and therefore the Proposal which he had made by Word of Mouth he
gave in Writing to the Heads of the <i>Arian</i> Faction, signed by himself
and his Fellow-legates. But the <i>Arians</i>, too well acquainted with their
Weakness to grant them any Terms, peremptorily insisted upon their
condemning <i>Athanasius</i>, and referring the Cause and Doctrine of
<i>Arius</i> to a more proper Juncture. <i>Vincentius</i> and his Collegues, finding
the Enemies of <i>Athanasius</i> thus inflexible, and, on the other hand,
determined at all Events to keep their Bishopricks, and avoid the Hardships
of a painful Exile, complied at last, and <i>yielded to the troublesome
Times</i>, to use their softening Expression<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c015'><sup>[728]</sup></a>. They were the more
inexcuseable, as they had before their Eyes the Example of a great
Prelate, whose Constancy was proof against all the Threats and
Menaces of a provoked Prince. This was the celebrated <i>Paulinus</i>
Bishop of <i>Treves</i>, who, after perusing the Formulary, drawn up by
the <i>Eusebians</i>, to be signed by him and the other Bishops, rejected it
with the utmost Indignation, declaring that nothing they could do
should ever induce him to betray the Truth, and his own Conscience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>by setting his Hand to such a scandalous Piece. The <i>Eusebians</i> left
no Art unattempted to gain him, as they had done the Pope’s Legates,
but finding he was a Man of a quite different Disposition, and despairing
of being ever able to prevail upon him either by Hopes or Fear,
they at last had recourse to the Emperor, who, putting his Decree in
Execution, sent him into Exile; and in order to tire out his Patience,
ordered him to be constantly conveyed from one inhospitable Place to
another. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The glorious Behaviour<br/>of</i> Paulinus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But in every Place <i>Paulinus</i> was the same, the Conscience
of his suffering for the sake of Justice enabling him to bear, not only
with Patience, but Chearfulness, the inexpressible Hardships he underwent<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c015'><sup>[729]</sup></a>.
He died in <i>Phrygia</i> in the Fifth Year of his Exile<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c015'><sup>[730]</sup></a>, that is,
in 358. But his Body is supposed to have been discovered in a Church
of his Name at <i>Treves</i>, in the Year 1071<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c015'><sup>[731]</sup></a>. How and when it was
conveyed thither, let those inquire who adore it.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return to <i>Liberius</i>, he was so sensibly affected with the Fall of
<i>Vincentius</i> and his Collegues, that he wished for an Opportunity of
losing his Life in so good a Cause, and washing out with his Blood the
Stain which the scandalous Conduct of his Legates had brought upon
his Character<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c015'><sup>[732]</sup></a>. Thus he expresses himself in the Letter, which he
writ on that Occasion to the great Friend of his See <i>Osius</i><a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c015'><sup>[733]</sup></a>. However,
in the Height of his Affliction, he found great Relief in the
Courage and Steadiness of <i>Cæcilianus</i> Bishop of <i>Spoleto</i>, of <i>Eusebius</i>
Bishop of <i>Vercelli</i>, and of <i>Lucifer</i> Bishop of <i>Cagliari</i> in <i>Sardinia</i>.
The latter advised the Pope to demand of the Emperor another Council,
and generously took upon himself to go to <i>Arles</i>, where <i>Constantius</i>
then was, and make that Demand. <i>Liberius</i> readily accepted
his Offer, and named <i>Pancratius</i> and <i>Hilarius</i> for his Collegues, the
one a Presbyter, the other a Deacon of the Church of <i>Rome</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Liberius <i>writes to<br/>the Emperor for an-<br/>other Council</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  By
these he writ an excellent Letter to the Emperor, wherein, with the
Liberty that became a Catholic Bishop, but at the same time with all
the Respect that is due from a Subject to his Sovereign, he justifies his
Conduct in the Defence of <i>Athanasius</i>, lays open the Arts and Views
of the adverse Party, and begs that a new Council might be assembled,
there being no other Means to put a Stop to so many Evils, and restore
Peace and Tranquillity to the Catholic Church<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c015'><sup>[734]</sup></a>. At the same time
<i>Liberius</i> writ to <i>Eusebius</i> Bishop of <i>Vercelli</i>, and <i>Fortunatianus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>, intreating them to assist his Legates with their
Advice, and even with their Presence, should it be thought necessary.
The Three Legates, on their Arrival at <i>Vercelli</i>, in their Way to <i>Arles</i>,
were not only kindly received, but joined by <i>Eusebius</i>, who repaired
with them to the Emperor. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which is granted,<br/>and assembles at</i> Milan.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As the <i>Arians</i> were no-ways averse to
the Proposal, nay, had even solicited the Emperor to convene a new
Council, the Request of the Legates met with no Difficulty; so that a
Council was appointed to meet at <i>Milan</i>, where it met accordingly in
the Beginning of the Year 355<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c015'><sup>[735]</sup></a>. We are told, that it consisted of
Three hundred Western Bishops, and that from the East there came
but very few<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c015'><sup>[736]</sup></a>. But <i>Constantius</i> and his Army may be said to have
supplied their room. For the Council no sooner met, than the Emperor
absolutely insisted upon their signing the Condemnation of <i>Athænasius</i>,
and an Edict, containing the chief Tenets of <i>Arius</i>, which had
been published in his Name. But in this Attempt he met with a
vigorous Opposition from <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, <i>Eusebius</i> of
<i>Vercelli</i>, <i>Lucifer</i> of <i>Cagliari</i>, and the Two other Legates, <i>Pancratius</i>
and <i>Hilarius</i>; which provoked him to such a Degree, that he
was upon the Point of commanding them to be executed upon the
Spot as Rebels. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some Bishops banished.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But, upon second Thoughts, he contented himself
with sending them into Exile, <i>Dionysius</i> into <i>Cappadocia</i>, or <i>Armenia</i>,
where he died a few Years after, <i>Eusebius</i> to <i>Scythopolis</i> in <i>Palestine</i>,
and <i>Lucifer</i> to <i>Germanicia</i> in <i>Syria</i>. To what Place <i>Pancratius</i>
and <i>Hilarius</i> were confined, we know not; but the latter was
most cruelly whipped before he was banished<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c015'><sup>[737]</sup></a>. As for the other Bishops,
I shall only say, with <i>Ruffinus</i><a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c015'><sup>[738]</sup></a>, that, out of Three hundred, <i>Dionysius</i>,
<i>Lucifer</i>, and <i>Eusebius</i>, alone shewed a Firmness and Intrepidity
becoming Men of their Rank and Dignity. Among the rest
<i>Fortunatianus</i> Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i> signed the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>;
which greatly added to the Grief and Concern of <i>Liberius</i>,
who, till that Time, had entertained the highest Opinion of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now <i>Constantius</i> had the Satisfaction of seeing <i>Athanasius</i>
condemned by the far greater Part of the Western Bishops. But the
Bishop of <i>Rome</i> still declared openly in his Favour, and did all that lay
in his Power to gain others to his Party. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantius <i>endeavours in<br/>vain to gain</i> Liber-<br/>ius;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  To deprive him therefore of
so powerful a Protector, the Emperor resolved to spare no Cost nor
Labour. With this View he dispatched to <i>Rome</i> the Eunuch <i>Eusebius</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>his great Chamberlain, with rich Presents in one Hand, and a threatening
Letter in the other: but with an invincible Firmness <i>Liberius</i>
withstood both; so that the Eunuch, who was himself a sworn Enemy
to <i>Athanasius</i>, returned to Court baffled and disappointed; and there,
by the Account he gave of his unsuccessful Embassy, added new Fuel
to the Fire, which burnt already with great Violence. The Emperor,
who pretended to govern the Church no less despotically than he did
the State, transported with Rage at the stout Opposition he met with
from the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, immediately dispatched an Order to <i>Leoncius</i>,
Prefect of that City, injoining him to apprehend <i>Liberius</i>, and
send him under a strong Guard to Court. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who is sent Pris-<br/>oner to</i> Milan.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Pursuant to this Order, <i>Liberius</i>
was seized in the Night-time, lest the People, by whom he was
greatly beloved, should attempt his Rescue, and conveyed to <i>Milan</i>,
where the Court then resided<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c015'><sup>[739]</sup></a>. Soon after his Arrival he was brought
before the Emperor, when, undaunted and unawed by the Presence
of so great a Prince, he spoke with all the Liberty of an Apostle, and
with all the Eloquence of a great Orator<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c015'><sup>[740]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Interview with<br/>the Emperor.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At this Interview were
present <i>Eusebius</i> the Eunuch, and <i>Epictetus</i> Bishop of <i>Centumcellæ</i>,
now <i>Civita Vecchia</i>, who, for his ready Compliance with the Emperor’s
Will, had been raised by him to great Preferments<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c015'><sup>[741]</sup></a>. The latter
told <i>Liberius</i>, when he had ended the excellent Speech he made
before the Emperor, That he had indeed expressed great Zeal for the
Purity of the Faith, and the Liberty of Councils; but the Whole was
mere Mummery; and that he only wanted to be looked upon by his
Party as a Person of some Significancy, and to brag among the Senators,
on his Return to <i>Rome</i>, that he had had the Honour to dispute
with the Emperor<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c015'><sup>[742]</sup></a>. The Eunuch too thought he must speak, but it
was only to betray his Ignorance; for he reproached <i>Liberius</i> with
defending <i>Athanasius</i>, who had been condemned, he said, as an Heretic,
by the Council of <i>Nice</i><a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c015'><sup>[743]</sup></a>. As for <i>Constantius</i>, the only Reply
he made to the Reasons alleged by <i>Liberius</i> in favour of <i>Athanasius</i>,
and the Faith of <i>Nice</i>, was, That the wicked and impious <i>Athanasius</i>,
as he styled him, had been condemned by the whole World; that, by
his arrogant Conduct, he had provoked all Mankind, and himself in
particular, by constantly stirring up his Brother against him; that
therefore he looked upon the Defeat of <i>Magnentius</i> and <i>Sylvanus</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>who had attempted to bereave him of his Crown, as less important to
him than the deposing and condemning of a Man, by whom he had
been so highly injured<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c015'><sup>[744]</sup></a>. In answer to this, <i>Liberius</i> begged, that,
of all Men, he would not chuse Bishops for the Instruments of his private
Revenge. <i>Constantius</i> made no Reply, but only told him, that
he must either sign the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>, or be sent into
Exile; and that he allowed him Three Days to deliberate which of
the Two he would chuse. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Steadiness.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Liberius</i> answered, with great Intrepidity,
that he had already chosen, and was resolved; that in Three Days he
should not change his Resolution; and therefore the Emperor might
send him that Minute to what Place soever he pleased<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c015'><sup>[745]</sup></a>. The Three
Days were not yet expired when the Emperor sent for him anew to
Court, hoping the Fear of Banishment had softened him, as it had
done most others, into a Compliance. But he found him unalterably
fixed in the same Resolution; and therefore, despairing of being ever
able to succeed in his Attempt, he ordered him to be conveyed forthwith
to <i>Ber&oelig;a</i> in <i>Thrace</i><a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c015'><sup>[746]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is banished to</i><br/>Ber&oelig;a <i>in</i> Thrace.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Liberius</i> had not yet left the Palace,
when the Emperor sent him a Present of Five hundred Pieces of Gold
to defray his Charges: which he sent back by the same Person who
brought them, saying, that the Emperor might want Money to pay
his Troops. The like Sum was sent him by the Empress <i>Eusebia</i>;
which, with the same Answer, he desired might be conveyed to the
Emperor, adding, that if he knew not how to employ that Sum better,
he might bestow it on <i>Epictetus</i>, or <i>Auxentius</i> the <i>Arian</i> Bishop
of <i>Milan</i>, who would be very thankful for it<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c015'><sup>[747]</sup></a>. He left <i>Milan</i>
Three Days after, and set out for the Place of his Exile. His Fate
was no sooner known at <i>Rome</i>, than the Clergy, assembling the
People, bound themselves by a solemn Oath, in their Presence, not
to acknowlege any other for their Bishop so long as <i>Liberius</i>
lived<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c015'><sup>[748]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Felix <i>is chosen in his<br/>room.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><i>Liberius</i> being thus driven from his See, another was placed on it in
his room; and the Person, whom the Emperor and the <i>Arian</i> Faction
pitched upon, was one <i>Felix</i>, then only Deacon of the Church of
<i>Rome</i><a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c015'><sup>[749]</sup></a>. But the Clergy could not proceed to a new Election, without
an open Violation of the Oath they had taken; the People began
to mutiny, and, assembling in Crouds, would suffer none of the <i>Arian</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Faction to enter their Churches. The Imperial Palace therefore served
instead of a Church; Three of the Emperor’s Eunuchs represented the
People; and Three Bishops, Slaves of the Court, <i>viz.</i> <i>Epictetus</i> of
<i>Centumcellæ</i>, <i>Acacius</i> of <i>Cæsarea</i>, and <i>Basilius</i> of <i>Ancyra</i>, ordained
the new-elected Bishop<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c015'><sup>[750]</sup></a>. Thus was <i>Felix</i> chosen, and thus ordained.
As <i>Liberius</i> was greatly beloved by the People, chiefly on account of
his vigorous Opposition to <i>Constantius</i>, the Intrusion of <i>Felix</i> occasioned
a great Sedition, in which many lost their Lives<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c015'><sup>[751]</sup></a>. The Clergy
were not so zealous in the Cause as the People; for great Numbers of
them, unmindful of the Oath they had taken, were by degrees reconciled
to <i>Felix</i>, and communicated with him<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c015'><sup>[752]</sup></a>; whereas the People
continued to abhor and avoid him at least till the Year 357. When <i>Constantius</i>
came to <i>Rome</i><a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c015'><sup>[753]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantius <i>goes<br/>to</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For that Prince, being desirous to see the
Metropolis of his Empire, undertook a Journey to <i>Rome</i> in the above-mentioned
Year, and entered it in Triumph on the 28th of <i>April</i><a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c015'><sup>[754]</sup></a>.
During his short Stay in that City, the <i>Roman</i> Ladies gave a signal Instance
of the Zeal and Affection they still retained for their exiled Bishop.
They thought a more favourable Opportunity could never offer
to solicit the Emperor for his Return; and therefore, by a private
Agreement among themselves, they pressed their Husbands, with great
Earnestness, to lay hold of it, threatening to abandon them, if they
did not, and repairing to their Bishop to share with him the Hardships
of his Exile. The Husbands, unmoved by such Menaces, which they
well knew would never take place, answered, that by such an Application
they might incur the Displeasure of the Prince, which would
prove fatal to them, as well as to the Person in whose Behalf they
interposed; whereas, should they themselves take such a pious and
commendable Office upon them, the Respect due to their Sex would,
in all Likelihood, extort from the Prince the desired Favour, at least
it would restrain his Resentment, and stifle all Thoughts of Revenge.
The Proposal was universally applauded by the Ladies, unwilling to
expose their Husbands to the dire Effects of the Emperor’s Indignation.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Roman <i>Ladies<br/>intercede for</i> Liberius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On an appointed Day therefore, attiring themselves in an Apparel suitable
to their Rank, that the Emperor in seeing them might know
who they were, and treat them accordingly, they repaired to Court;
and being immediately admitted to the Prince’s Presence, they conjured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>him, with Tears in their Eyes, to take Pity of that great City,
of that numerous Flock, bereft of its Pastor, and, in his Absence,
devoured by ravenous Wolves. This was not at all a courtly Language:
however, <i>Constantius</i>, without betraying the least Emotion,
said, <i>I thought you had a Pastor. Is not</i> Felix <i>as capable of discharging
the Pastoral Office as any other?</i> Felix, replied they, <i>is
detested, and avoided by all</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Emperor promises<br/>to recall him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At these Words the Emperor first looked
grave; but, immediately changing his Gravity into a Smile, <i>If so</i>, said
he, with great Complaisance, <i>you must have</i> Liberius <i>again: I shall,
without Delay, dispatch the proper Orders for his Return</i>. An
Edict was accordingly issued the very next Day, recalling <i>Liberius</i> to
govern the Church jointly with <i>Felix</i>; for <i>Constantius</i> thought it inconsistent
with his Honour, and the Imperial Dignity, to drive <i>Felix</i>
from the See, on which he himself had placed him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Edict recalling<br/>him to govern jointly<br/>with</i> Felix, <i>raillied<br/>by the</i> Roman <i>People.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>When this Edict was read, in the Presence of the Emperor, to the
People assembled in the <i>Circus</i>, they applauded it at first, by way of
Raillery, saying, That since the Spectators, at the public Sports, were
divided into Two Parties, it was just and reasonable there should be
Two Bishops to head them. The Multitude, not satisfied with thus
pleasantly expressing their Dissatisfaction, cried out, immediately after,
with one Voice, <i>There is but One God, One Christ, One Bishop</i><a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c015'><sup>[755]</sup></a>.
And yet the Emperor was rather delighted than displeased with the
Humour of the People, and the Liberty they took; for to what happened
on this Occasion <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> probably alludes, where
he writes, that <i>Constantius</i>, in exhibiting public Sports at <i>Rome</i>, was
pleased with the Liberty they took to railly him, knowing it did not
proceed from Pride or Ill-nature<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c015'><sup>[756]</sup></a>. <i>Theodoret</i> tells us, that to Acclamations
so worthy of the <i>Roman</i> Piety the Emperor granted the
Return of <i>Liberius</i><a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c015'><sup>[757]</sup></a>; and with him agree <i>Sulpitius Severus</i><a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c015'><sup>[758]</sup></a>, and
<i>Ruffinus</i><a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c015'><sup>[759]</sup></a>. But <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c015'><sup>[760]</sup></a>, and all the Writers of those Times,
assure us, that his Return did not happen this, but the following
Year 358. when he bought it dear, by signing the Condemnation of
<i>Athanasius</i>, and the Symbol or Creed, composed by the <i>Semi-Arians</i>
at <i>Sirmium</i>, now <i>Sirmish</i> in <i>Sclavonia</i>. <i>Constantius</i>, at the Request
of the <i>Roman</i> Ladies and People, promised to recall him, as I have
related; but it was on Condition, says <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c015'><sup>[761]</sup></a>, that he should
agree with the Bishops of the Court, that is, with the <i>Semi-Arians</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The Firmness which <i>Liberius</i> had hitherto shewn, left no room to
doubt of his rejecting such a Proposal with the greatest Indignation.
But he now felt what before he had only beheld at a Distance: he
began to compare the Ease and Plenty in which he had lived at
<i>Rome</i>, with the Inconveniencies and Hardships of his present Exile.
Besides, from the Menaces thrown out against him by the Emperor’s
Officers, he apprehended his Life to be in Danger<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c015'><sup>[762]</sup></a>. 'Tis true, he had
wished for an Opportunity of shedding his Blood in so good a Cause,
as I have related above. But who is not brave at a Distance from
Danger? The Jealousy he had of <i>Felix</i>, who, sitting in his Chair, acted
the High Pontiff at <i>Rome</i>, was the <i>Dalila</i>, says <i>Baronius</i><a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c015'><sup>[763]</sup></a>, speaking
of his signing the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>, who bereft this
<i>Samson</i> of all his Strength and Courage. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Liberius <i>signs the<br/>Condemnation<br/>of</i> Athanasius, <i>and<br/>embraces the Doct-<br/>rine of</i> Sirmium.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However that be, it is
certain, that the Strength and Courage, which he had with great
Glory exerted on other Occasions, vanished at once. For he not
only signed the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>, but moreover approved
and received as Catholic, the Confession or Symbol of <i>Sirmium</i><a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c015'><sup>[764]</sup></a>.
Thus, to ingratiate himself with the Emperor, and return
to <i>Rome</i>, did <i>Liberius</i> abandon, at last, his persecuted Friend, renounce
the Catholic Faith, and solemnly promise to maintain inviolable
the Doctrine of <i>Sirmium</i><a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c015'><sup>[765]</sup></a>. As he was impatient to be reinstated
in his See, he took care immediately to acquaint the Emperor
with the Steps he had taken. With this Letter he dispatched
<i>Fortunatianus</i> Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>, charging him to solicit <i>Constantius</i>
for his Return, since he had done all he had required of
him<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c015'><sup>[766]</sup></a>. <i>Constantius</i> took no Notice of, nor returned any Answer to,
this Letter. On the other hand, <i>Liberius</i> was heartily sick of his
Exile, heartily sick of suffering for the sake of Justice. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Letter to the<br/>Eastern Bishops.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In Hopes
therefore of putting a speedy End to his Exile, and the Hardships
attending it, he writ in a most submissive and cringing Style to the
Eastern Bishops, assuring them, that it was merely out of Respect to
his Predecessor <i>Julius</i>, and to maintain his Judgment, that he had
undertaken the Defence of <i>Athanasius</i>; that as soon as it had pleased
God to open his Eyes, and discover to him how justly he had been
condemned, he had separated himself from his Communion, and
joined them; that all their Decrees concerning him should be inviolably
observed by the Apostolic See, as indeed they ought to be;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>that he sincerely and willingly received the true Catholic and Orthodox
Faith, as it had been expounded and defined by several of his
Brethren and Collegues at <i>Sirmium</i>, and had been proposed to him
by his Collegue <i>Demophilus</i>; that he received every Article of that
Symbol, and had nothing to object against any. This remarkable
Letter he concludes thus: <i>And now that I agree with you in every
Point, let me earnestly intreat your Holinesses to employ your joint
Interest in my Behalf, that I may be recalled from Banishment, and
suffered to return to the See, which God has been pleased to commit
to my Care</i><a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c015'><sup>[767]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is anathematized<br/>by</i> Hilarius. <i>His Letter<br/>to the Bishops at<br/>Court</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Letter has been conveyed to us by the great
<i>Hilarius</i>, Bishop of <i>Poitiers</i>, who, in relating it, not able to restrain
the just Indignation it kindled in his Breast, interrupts the Recital
Three times, to anathematize the Author of it, the <i>prevaricating Liberius</i>,
as he styles him<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c015'><sup>[768]</sup></a>. He writ likewise to <i>Ursacius</i>, <i>Valens</i>,
and <i>Germinius</i>, who bore great Sway at Court, and were at the Head
of the <i>Arian</i> Faction in the West, to acquaint them, that he communicated
with them, and also with <i>Auxentius</i> and <i>Epictetus</i>, Two
of the most inveterate Enemies the Orthodox had; and that whoever
did not communicate with them, that is, every Catholic Bishop, was
cut off from his Communion. These Words <i>Hilarius</i> cannot repeat
without anathematizing anew <i>Liberius</i>, and all the <i>Arians</i> with him.
In the same Letter he lets them know, that he has separated himself
from the Communion of <i>Athanasius</i>, <i>late Bishop of</i> Alexandria,
acknowleging him, by that Expression, lawfully deposed. He declares,
in the Beginning of his Letter, and calls God to witness, that it is
not by Compulsion, but merely for the sake of Peace and Charity, far
preferable to Martyrdom itself, that he writes to them. He conjures
them, by the omnipotent God, by his Son <i>Jesus</i>, by the Holy Ghost,
to intercede for him with the Emperor, that, by his Return, Peace
and Tranquillity may be restored to the Church committed to his Care;
assuring them, that the Zeal they exert in so pious, so just a Cause,
will meet with a proportionable Reward in Heaven<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c015'><sup>[769]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the Emperor had not yet taken the least Notice of his Letter;
as the Eastern Bishops, as well as the Bishops at Court, did not act,
as he thought, with all the Zeal and Expedition he expected, and
his ready Compliance well deserved; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and to</i> Vincentius,<br/><i>Bishop of</i> Capua.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  he writ a Third Letter, directed
to <i>Vincentius</i>, Bishop of <i>Capua</i>, acquainting him, that he had
abandoned the Defence of <i>Athanasius</i>, and desiring him to give Notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>thereof to all the Bishops of <i>Campania</i>; and, at the same time,
to use his utmost Endeavours to persuade them to dispatch some of
their Body with a Letter, in their common Name, to the Emperor,
begging <i>Constantius</i> to deliver him, without further Delay, from his
present most melancholy and deplorable Situation. To this Letter he
adds the following Paragraph, in his own Hand: <i>We live in Peace
with all the Bishops of the East, and with you. As for me, I have
discharged my Conscience before God. Will you suffer me to perish in
my present Exile? The same God will judge us both</i><a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c015'><sup>[770]</sup></a>. The Bishop
of <i>Capua</i> had been formerly sent by <i>Liberius</i> to the Council of
<i>Arles</i>, with the Character of his Legate, as I have observed above,
and had there signed the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>; on which
Occasion <i>Liberius</i> wished for an Opportunity of washing out, with
his own Blood, the Stain which the Conduct of his Legate had
brought upon his Character. But his only Wish now was to see himself
delivered from his painful Exile, and restored to his former State,
upon any Terms. <i>Vincentius</i>, touched with his Complaints, prevailed
upon the Bishops of <i>Campania</i> to send a solemn Deputation to
the Emperor in his Behalf; which <i>Constantius</i> complied with, so far
as to recall him from the Place of his Exile to <i>Sirmium</i>, where the
Court then was<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c015'><sup>[771]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is recalled from<br/>his Banishment to</i><br/>Sirmium.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Upon his Arrival there, <i>Constantius</i>, who had
lately embraced the Doctrine of the <i>Semi-Arians</i>, taking Advantage
of his Weakness, and of the eager Desire he had betrayed of returning
to his See, obliged him, as well as the Bishops of the Court, and
Four <i>African</i> Bishops, who happened to be then at <i>Sirmium</i>, to sign
the same Doctrine<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c015'><sup>[772]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He signs the Doctrine<br/>of the</i> Semi-Arians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Thus did the infallible <i>Liberius</i> sign, and embrace,
at least in Appearance, both the <i>Arian</i> and <i>Semi-Arian</i> Heresy;
the <i>Arian</i> at <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, the Place of his Exile, and the <i>Semi-Arian</i>
at <i>Sirmium</i>. That the Confession he signed at <i>Ber&oelig;a</i> was
<i>Arian</i>, cannot be doubted; for it was the Second of <i>Sirmium</i>, which
all agree to have been <i>Arian</i><a id='rN16' /><a href='#fN16' class='c015'><sup>[N16]</sup></a>. Besides, it was proposed to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>by <i>Demophilus</i> Bishop of <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, who was a most zealous Stickler
for <i>Arianism</i>, and greatly attached to <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>, the Two
leading Men among the <i>Arians</i> in the West; and it is not at all probable,
that he would have required <i>Liberius</i> to sign a Doctrine different
from that which he himself held.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN16'>N16</a>. Three Councils were held at <i>Sirmium</i>,
one in 349. another in 352. and the
Third in 357. In the First, <i>Photinus</i>, Bishop
of that City, was condemned, for reviving
the Heresy of <i>Paul</i> of <i>Samosata</i>.
This Council was intirely composed of the
Western Bishops, who attempted to depose
<i>Photinus</i>, but were vigorously opposed by
the People. The Second Council of <i>Sirmium</i>
was convened by the Emperor <i>Constantius</i>,
and consisted of the Eastern Bishops
only, who condemned anew, and deposed
<i>Photinus</i>. By this Council a Symbol,
or Creed, was composed, which has been
transmitted to us in <i>Greek</i> by St. <i>Athanasius</i>,
and in <i>Latin</i> by St. <i>Hilarius</i>; and is
intirely Orthodox. In the Third Council
of <i>Sirmium</i> a new Creed was composed by
<i>Potamius</i> Bishop of <i>Lisbone</i>, and signed by
<i>Ursacius</i>, <i>Valens</i>, <i>Germinius</i>, and the other
Bishops there present. This Creed was altogether
<i>Arian</i>; for not only the Word
<i>Consubstantial</i> was rejected by it, but the
Son was declared to be unlike the Father
in Essence, to be less than the Father, and
to have had a Beginning. And it was this
Second Symbol of <i>Sirmium</i> that <i>Liberius</i>
signed at <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>. Upon his Arrival at <i>Sirmium</i>
he found there <i>Basilius</i> of <i>Ancyra</i>,
<i>Eleusius</i> of <i>Cyzicus</i>, and the other <i>Semi-Arian</i>
Bishops, who were lately come from
the Council of <i>Ancyra</i>, where they had condemned
the Doctrine of the <i>Pure Arians</i>,
and established that of the <i>Semi-Arians</i>,
holding the Son to be like the Father in
Nature and Essence, but not <i>Consubstantial</i>,
or of the same Substance. And this Doctrine
<i>Liberius</i> signed out of Complaisance to
the Emperor, that nothing might obstruct
his Return to <i>Rome</i>. He signed it in a kind
of Council, consisting of the <i>Semi-Arian</i>
Bishops, whom I have mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Advocates for the Pope’s Infallibility are here quite at a Loss
what to say in Defence of that Prerogative. That <i>Liberius</i> signed
the Condemnation of <i>Athanasius</i>, that he communicated with the
<i>Arians</i>, and, what above all galls them, that he received the <i>Sirmian</i>
Confession of Faith as Catholic and Orthodox, are undeniable
Matters of Fact. To reconcile them with Infallibility, is what they
have been long drudging at: and to what pitiful Shifts, what eluding
and unmeaning Distinctions, have they not been obliged to recur!
Like a Man struggling for Life in deep Water, and catching at
every Twig to save it, they flounce from Quibble to Quibble, from
one Subterfuge to another, but all in vain; sink they must, and their
Infallibility with them. To shew their Distress, I shall briefly transcribe
what I find offered on this Occasion, by the most learned among
them, in Defence of the Cause they have undertaken. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>What alleged by</i><br/>Baronius <i>in his<br/>Defence</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Baronius</i><a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c015'><sup>[773]</sup></a>, after
relating and owning the above-mentioned Facts, addresses his Readers
thus: <i>We have hitherto sailed among dangerous Rocks, among
treacherous Sholes; but fear not, I shall at last pilot you safe into
the Port of Truth</i>. Then, dropping his Allegory, he makes a long
Descant to prove, that the <i>Sirmian</i> Confession of Faith, signed by
<i>Liberius</i>, was, in every Article, Catholic and Orthodox. A rare Pilot
indeed! If this (to pursue his Allegory) is <i>the Port of Truth</i>, who can
help pitying <i>Jerom</i>, <i>Hilarius</i>, <i>Athanasius</i>, and in short all the Antients?
for they certainly missed it, and, falling in among those <i>dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Rocks, those treacherous Sholes</i>, which <i>Baronius</i> had the Skill
and good Luck to avoid, were there unfortunately shipwrecked. For
<i>Jerom</i> says, in express Terms, and in Two Places<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c015'><sup>[774]</sup></a>, that <i>Liberius</i>
signed an Heresy; <i>Hilarius</i>, that he approved of the <i>Arian</i> Perfidy<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c015'><sup>[775]</sup></a>;
<i>Athanasius</i>, that he joined the <i>Arians</i><a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c015'><sup>[776]</sup></a>; and all the Antients, that
he apostatized from the Faith: nay, <i>Liberius</i> himself, in his Letter
to the Orientals, which is still to be seen, under his own Hand, in the
<i>Vatican</i> Library, gives them Notice, that <i>in all things</i> he agrees
with <i>Demophilus</i>, a most zealous <i>Arian</i>, and with them; which
Words <i>Hilarius</i> could not repeat without anathematizing him. It is
therefore manifest, beyond all Dispute, that the Confession of Faith,
signed by <i>Liberius</i>, was not Catholic, but <i>Arian</i>. Of this <i>Baronius</i>
himself was, without doubt, well apprised, and into this Port he had
piloted his Reader, had Truth alone been his Land-mark.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and by</i> Bellarmine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Bellarmine</i>,
the other great Stickler for Infallibility, pursues a different Method,
but with worse Success, in my Opinion, than his Fellow-Champion
<i>Baronius</i>; for, by striving to support that chimerical Prerogative,
he evidently oversets it. The Pope, according to him, may
sign and receive heretical Opinions, as <i>Liberius</i> did, without prejudicing
in the least his Infallibility, provided he does not internally
assent to them<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c015'><sup>[777]</sup></a>; so that the so much boasted Infallibility is by him
reduced at last to this; that the Pope cannot internally assent to an
Error: which is confining his Infallibility to himself, and consequently
disqualifying him for the Office of a Teacher. Infallibility,
even thus curtailed, is, no doubt, a most valuable Treasure to the
Owner, but of no more Use to the rest of Mankind than a Treasure
concealed under-ground; and, on that very Account, it ought in
common Sense to be exploded. But it is scarce worth the while to
quarrel with <i>Bellarmine</i> about it, since he cannot be so unreasonable
as to require us, in virtue of such a Prerogative, to pay any Regard
to the Decisions of the Pope, till such time, at least, as we
know them to be agreeable to his private Opinion: and this is what
we can never know, since every Pope may, like <i>Liberius</i>, externally
admit an Opinion as true; and, at the same time, internally reject it as
false.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Liberius <i>returns to</i><br/>Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>But, to return to <i>Liberius</i>; he was at last, in regard of his ready
Compliance with the Will of the Emperor, allowed to return to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><i>Rome</i>; but on Condition, that he should govern jointly with <i>Felix</i><a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c015'><sup>[778]</sup></a>.
Letters were accordingly dispatched both to <i>Felix</i>, and the
<i>Roman</i> Clergy, to acquaint them therewith. <i>Sozomen</i> seems to insinuate,
that they both governed thus for some time<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c015'><sup>[779]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Felix <i>is driven out.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But, according
to St. <i>Jerom</i>, and the Two Presbyters <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>,
who lived then at <i>Rome</i>, and were Eye-witnesses of what they relate,
<i>Felix</i> was driven not only from the See, but out of the City, as
soon as <i>Liberius</i> entered it; which he did on the 2d of <i>August</i> 358.
in a kind of Triumph, being met and received by the whole People,
with loud Acclamations of Joy<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c015'><sup>[780]</sup></a>. <i>Felix</i> returned soon after, at the
Instigation of a few of the Ecclesiastics, who had, contrary to their Oath,
adhered to him; and even attempted to perform Divine Service in
the Basilic of <i>Julius</i>, beyond the <i>Tiber</i>; but the enraged Multitude
drove him out a second time, and, with him, all the Ecclesiastics,
who had acknowleged him<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c015'><sup>[781]</sup></a>. <i>Socrates</i> writes, that the Emperor
himself was in the End obliged to give him up, and consent to his
Expulsion<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c015'><sup>[782]</sup></a>. Mention is made in the Pontificals of a bloody Persecution,
raised in <i>Rome</i> by <i>Liberius</i>, and his Party, against the Partisans
of <i>Felix</i>, who, it is said, were inhumanly murdered in the
Streets, in the Baths, in all public Places, and even in the Churches<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c015'><sup>[783]</sup></a>.
But as none of the Antients take the least Notice of such Cruelties,
I will not charge <i>Liberius</i> with them, upon the bare Authority of
such Records. <i>Felix</i>, being driven from <i>Rome</i>, withdrew to a small
Estate he had on the Road to <i>Porto</i>, and there spent the remaining
Part of his Life in Retirement<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c015'><sup>[784]</sup></a>. <i>Sozomen</i> supposes him to have
died soon after<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c015'><sup>[785]</sup></a>. But the Two Presbyters <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>,
who must have been better informed, assure us, that he lived Seven
Years after the Return of <i>Liberius</i>, and died on the 22d of <i>November</i>
365<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c015'><sup>[786]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Judgment of the<br/>Antients concerning</i><br/>Felix.</div>

<p class='c001'>Concerning <i>Felix</i>, all the Antients agree, that he was unlawfully
elected and ordained; that he communicated with the <i>Arians</i>; that,
to ingratiate himself with them, and the Emperor, he signed the Condemnation
of <i>Athanasius</i>; that he was guilty of Perjury in accepting
the Episcopal Dignity, having bound himself, with the rest of the
Clergy, by a solemn Oath, to acknowlege no other Bishop while
<i>Liberius</i> lived; and, lastly, that he strove to keep Possession of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span><i>Roman</i> See, after the Return of the lawful Bishop, and to sit in it,
together with him, in open Defiance of the Canons of the Church.
<i>Socrates</i> adds, that he not only communicated with the <i>Arians</i>, but
was infected with the <i>Arian</i> Heresy<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c015'><sup>[787]</sup></a>. <i>Athanasius</i> styles him <i>a Monster,
raised to the See of</i> Rome <i>by the Malice of Antichrist, one worthy
of those who raised him, and in every respect well qualified for
the Execution of their wicked Designs</i><a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c015'><sup>[788]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is honoured by<br/>the Church of</i> Rome<br/><i>as a Saint and a<br/>Martyr.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  And yet this Heretic, this
Monster, this Intruder, or Antipope, is honoured (the Reader will be
surprised to hear it, is honoured) by the Church of <i>Rome</i> as a Saint;
nay, as a Martyr; and his Festival is kept to this Day, on the 29th
of <i>July</i>. This Honour was conferred on him in the Ages of Darkness
and Ignorance, upon the Authority of his fabulous Acts, and a
more fabulous Pontifical, from which his Acts seem to have been
copied. In the Pontifical it is said, that <i>Felix</i> declared <i>Constantius</i>,
who had been twice baptized, an Heretic; and was therefore, by an
Order from the incensed Emperor, apprehended, and privately beheaded,
with many Ecclesiastics and Laymen, under the Walls of
<i>Rome</i>, on the 11th of <i>November</i>. It is added, that the Presbyter
<i>Damasus</i> privately conveyed his Body to a Church, which <i>Felix</i> had
built, and there interred it; and that, upon his Death, the See remained
vacant for the Space of Thirty-eight Days<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c015'><sup>[789]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His fabulous Acts.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In the Acts of
<i>Felix</i> we read, that <i>Constantius</i> was rebaptized by <i>Eusebius</i> Bishop
of <i>Nicomedia</i>; that <i>Felix</i> having, on that Account, declared him an
Heretic, he was driven from the See of <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Liberius</i> replaced
on it; that <i>Felix</i> thereupon retired into the Country, but was
brought back by the Emperor’s Orders, and beheaded on the 10th
of <i>November</i>; that his Body was interred on the 20th of the same
Month in a Church, which he had built while he was a Presbyter:
And we keep his Festival, adds the Author, on the 29th of <i>July</i><a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c015'><sup>[790]</sup></a>.
<i>Anastasius</i> has copied the Pontifical Word for Word, except that he
pretends <i>Felix</i> to have been beheaded at <i>Cora</i>, in the <i>Campagna</i> of
<i>Rome</i><a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c015'><sup>[791]</sup></a>; though he has told us, in the foregoing Page, that he <i>died
in Peace</i>, a Phrase never used in speaking of Martyrs, on the 29th
of <i>July</i>, at his Estate on the Road to <i>Porto</i><a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c015'><sup>[792]</sup></a>. The City of <i>Cere</i>,
now <i>Cerventera</i>, in <i>Tuscany</i>, honours <i>Felix</i> to this Day, as their chief
Patron or Protector. In those dark Times Legends alone were in
request, and all other Books, even the Scripture itself, quite out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Date, and neglected. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How he came to be<br/>honoured as a Saint.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  No Wonder therefore that such Absurdities,
however inconsistent with History, were swallowed without straining;
and <i>Felix</i>, for his pretended Zeal and Constancy, ranked among the
holy Martyrs. For I may venture to affirm, that the most learned
Men, at that time, in the Church, knew nothing of <i>Felix</i> but what
they had learned from his fabulous Acts, and from the above-mentioned
Pontifical. That I may not be thought to exaggerate, I shall
allege one Instance of the Ignorance of past Times: <i>Gulielmus a
Sancto Amore</i>, one of the most learned Men of the 13th Century,
knew that, in the Time of <i>Hilarius</i> Bishop of <i>Poitiers</i>, a Pope,
with most of the Bishops, had fallen into Heresy. He did not even
pretend to be so well versed in History as to know for certain who
the Pope was; but, indulging a Conjecture, which he thought probable
enough, he named <i>Anastasius</i> II. who died in 498. about 150
Years after the Time of <i>Hilarius</i>: so that he was an utter Stranger
to the History of Pope <i>Liberius</i>, and consequently to that of the Antipope
<i>Felix</i>. Had it not been for the like Ignorance in more early
Times, the Apotheosis of our pretended Martyr had never taken
place. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Sanctity called in<br/>question;</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Be that as it will, during the Ages of Darkness he held undisturbed
the Rank, to which he had been thus raised: but when the
Dawn of Knowlege began to appear, and it was discovered at last
from contemporary and unexceptionable Writers, who <i>Felix</i> was, the
Church of <i>Rome</i> was ashamed to own him among her Saints. On
the other hand, to degrade him had been giving a fatal Blow to the
Pope’s Authority, and rendering it for ever precarious, in so material
a Point as that of Canonization. <i>Felix</i> therefore was, at all Events,
to keep his Place in Heaven; his Sanctity was to be confirmed, and
the World imposed upon by some Contrivance or other, capable of
utterly defeating the Testimony of the Antients.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Point being settled, to prevent all Suspicion of Deceit, or
underhand Dealings, Pope <i>Gregory</i> XIII. declared, in 1582. his Intention
of having the Cause of <i>Felix</i> impartially examined. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and his Cause re-<br/>examined.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In order to <a id='corr143.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='[missing]'>?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_143.32'><ins class='correction' title='[missing]'>?</ins></a></span>
this, he appointed <i>Baronius</i>, employed at that Time in reforming the
<i>Roman</i> Martyrology, to put in Writing whatever could be objected
against <i>Felix</i>, and Cardinal <i>Santorio</i> to answer his Objections, and
collect likewise in Writing all that could be said in favour of his new
Client, that the Pope might be thoroughly acquainted with the Merits
of the Cause before he came to a final Decision. This Conduct in
<i>Gregory</i> has been censured by some over-zealous Divines of the Church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of <i>Rome</i>, as if he had thereby given the World Occasion to think
that he questioned the Infallibility of his Predecessors, who had honoured
<i>Felix</i> as a Saint<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c015'><sup>[793]</sup></a>. But <i>Gregory</i> well knew what he was doing,
and how the Whole would end. In Compliance with his Orders,
<i>Baronius</i> writ a Dissertation, which he himself calls a Volume, and
not a short one<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c015'><sup>[794]</sup></a>, to prove that <i>Felix</i> was neither a Saint nor a Martyr.
As he had Truth on his Side, Cardinal <i>Santorio</i>, though a Man
of Learning, could neither answer his Arguments, nor offer any thing
in so desperate a Cause worthy of himself. He often addressed himself
in his Prayers to his Client, intreating him to undertake his own
Cause, by suggesting to him what might be alleged in his Defence.
But the Client was no less at a Stand than the Advocate. Some other
Person therefore must interpose: And whom did the carrying or losing
such a Cause more nearly concern than the Pope, since his Authority
in a most essential Point was at Stake? This was a nice Affair, and to be
managed with great Art and Dexterity. <i>Gregory</i>, therefore, having often
heard both Sides, in a full Congregation of Cardinals, without betraying
the least Partiality for <i>Felix</i>, appointed them to meet for the last
time on the 28th of <i>July</i>, the Eve of the pretended Saint’s Festival,
judging that the most proper Time to play off with good Success the
Trick, which he had kept the whole Time <i>in petto</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Sanctity and<br/>Martyrdom confirmed<br/>by the Discovery of<br/>his Body.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Cardinals
met on the Day appointed; <i>Baronius</i> quite silenced his Adversary;
the whole Assembly was fully convinced, that <i>Felix</i> was no Saint, no
Martyr; the Pope himself seemed to fall in with the rest, and accordingly
rose up to declare, as was thought, the unhappy <i>Felix</i> fallen
from Heaven; when a great Noise was all on a sudden heard at the
Door, and immediately a Messenger entered, who, after uttering
these Words, <i>Holy</i> Felix, <i>pray for us</i>, acquainted the Pope and the
Cardinals, that the Body of <i>Felix</i> was just discovered. Hereupon
they all repaired in great Haste to the Church of <i>Cosmas</i> and <i>Damianus</i>,
where the miraculous Discovery had been made; and there saw,
in a Marble Coffin of an extraordinary Size, on one Side the Bodies
of <i>Mark</i>, <i>Marcellianus</i>, and <i>Tranquillinus</i>; and on the other that of
<i>Felix</i>, with this Inscription on a Stone that lay by it, <i>The Body of
Saint</i> Felix, <i>who condemned</i> Constantius<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c015'><sup>[795]</sup></a>. Hereupon the <i>Te Deum</i>
was sung with great Solemnity for the Triumph of Truth: <i>Felix</i> was
declared worthy of the Veneration and Worship that had till then been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>paid him, and a Place was allowed him among the other Saints in the
<i>Roman</i> Martyrology, where it is said, that <i>he was driven from his
See for defending the Catholic Faith, by</i> Constantius <i>an</i> Arian <i>Emperor,
and privately put to Death at</i> Cere, <i>now</i> Cervetera, <i>in</i> Tuscany.
<i>Baronius</i>, transported with Joy, as he himself declares<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c015'><sup>[796]</sup></a>, at
so miraculous and seasonable a Discovery, immediately yielded, not
to his Antagonist <i>Santorio</i>, but to <i>Felix</i>, who had evidently interposed;
and, taking that Interposition for a satisfactory Answer to all his Arguments,
he immediately retracted whatever he had said, and consigned
to the Flames whatever he had written in Opposition to <i>Felix</i><a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c015'><sup>[797]</sup></a>.
Thus, to maintain a chimerical Prerogative, they sport with Truth;
betray into Error those who confide in them; and, turning the worst
of Men into Saints, honour Vice with the greatest Reward they can
bestow on Virtue.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Legend proved to<br/>be fabulous.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>That this pretended Discovery was nothing but a Contrivance to
confirm the Martyrdom of <i>Felix</i>, and impose upon the World, is
manifest; and that the Pontifical, and his Acts, on which his Martyrdom
was originally founded, were a no less palpable and gross Imposition,
may be easily demonstrated. For, in the first place, <i>Marcellinus</i>
and <i>Faustinus</i>, who lived in the Time of <i>Felix</i> and <i>Liberius</i> at
<i>Rome</i>, tell us, in express Terms, that <i>Felix, who had been substituted
to</i> Liberius, <i>died on the 22d of</i> November 365<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c015'><sup>[798]</sup></a>. that is, Four Years
after the Death of <i>Constantius</i>, by whom he is said, in his Acts, and
in the Pontifical, to have been martyred. <i>Athanasius</i> assures us<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c015'><sup>[799]</sup></a>, and
with him agree <i>Philostorgius</i><a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c015'><sup>[800]</sup></a>, and the Chronicle of <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c015'><sup>[801]</sup></a>,
that <i>Constantius</i> was not baptized till at the Point of Death, when he
received that Sacrament at the Hands of <i>Euzoius</i>, the <i>Arian</i> Bishop of
<i>Antioch</i>. And yet both the Acts of <i>Felix</i>, and the Pontifical, will
have him to have been twice baptized before his Death; for it was on
this Account that <i>Felix</i> is said to have declared him an Heretic. This
Declaration <i>Baronius</i> improves into a solemn Excommunication; and,
being become, after the above-mentioned Discovery, a most zealous
Advocate for <i>Felix</i>, tells us, that the holy Martyr was no sooner placed
on the Throne of St. <i>Peter</i>, than, changing his Conduct, he separated
himself from the Communion of those by whom he had been raised,
and boldly thundered an Anathema against the Emperor himself<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c015'><sup>[802]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He did not excom-<br/>municate</i> Constantius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What a Pity that <i>Athanasius</i> was not better acquainted with the Conduct
of <i>Felix</i>! for if he had, he would never have styled him <i>a Monster
placed on the See of</i> Rome <i>by the Malice of Antichrist</i>. Such an
Attempt, unheard of till that Time, must have made a great Noise;
and yet I find it was heard by none but <i>Baronius</i>, who lived at so great
a Distance. I may add, that there was no room for an Excommunication
against <i>Constantius</i>, who was still a Catechumen, and consequently
did not partake of the sacred Mysteries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Whether a lawful<br/>Pope or an Antipope.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The <i>Roman</i> Catholic Writers, to save the Credit of <i>Felix</i>, maintain
him to have been, at least for some time, lawful Pope. But, to
confute whatever has been or can be said by them in his Favour, without
entering into a Detail of the many sophistical and unconclusive
Arguments, false Assertions, and groundless Suppositions, with which
they endeavour to disguise the Truth, and confound their Readers,
I argue thus: That <i>Liberius</i> was lawfully chosen, and <i>Felix</i> unlawfully,
is past all Dispute. Now, upon the Fall of <i>Liberius</i>, either
there was, or there was not, a new Election: if there was not, <i>Liberius</i>
continued to be lawful Bishop; or if by his Fall he forfeited
his Dignity, as some think he did, the See became vacant; for nothing
subsequent to the unlawful Election of <i>Felix</i> could render it lawful.
If there was a new Election, and <i>Felix</i> was lawfully chosen, <i>Liberius</i>
from that Minute either ceased to be Pope, or there were two lawful
Popes at a time. The latter they will not admit, lest they should
turn the Church into a Monster with Two Heads. They must therefore
allow <i>Felix</i> to have been lawful Pope, and <i>Liberius</i> an Antipope,
till the See became vacant by the Death of the former. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Felix <i>an Antipope.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But
on the other hand, this new Election is quite groundless, highly improbable,
and absolutely repugnant to what we read in the antient
and contemporary Writers. It is quite groundless; for though <i>Bellarmine</i>
speaks of a new Election with as much Confidence as if he had
been one of the Electors<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c015'><sup>[803]</sup></a>, yet we find not the least Hint of it in any
of the Writers of those Times, who would not have passed over in Silence
so remarkable an Event, had it come to their Knowlege. It is
highly improbable; for <i>Liberius</i> was greatly beloved by the whole
People, and the far greater Part of the Clergy, and <i>Felix</i> hated to
such a Degree, that of all the Inhabitants of <i>Rome</i>, not one ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>appeared in the Church while he was in it<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c015'><sup>[804]</sup></a>; nay, he was by all
avoided, even in the Streets and other public Places, as if he had
carried about with him a Contagion<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c015'><sup>[805]</sup></a>. Is it not therefore altogether
improbable, that the People and Clergy should depose the Man, whom
in a manner they adored, for communicating with the <i>Arians</i>, and
appoint one in his room, who likewise communicated with them,
and was universally detested, avoided, and abhorred? And yet all
this is gravely supposed by <i>Bellarmine</i><a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c015'><sup>[806]</sup></a>. Lastly, the Election of <i>Felix</i>
is repugnant to what we read in the antient Writers, who all speak of
him as an Antipope, and an Intruder. <i>Optatus</i>, who lived at that
very Time, and St. <i>Austin</i>, who flourished soon after, have not allowed
him a Place in their Catalogues of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>. <i>Theodoret</i>
takes no notice of him in his Catalogue of the Bishops of the
chief Cities. St. <i>Jerom</i> and <i>Prosper</i> count <i>Liberius</i> the Thirty-fourth
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Damasus</i>, who succeeded him, the Thirty-fifth;
a plain Indication that they did not look upon <i>Felix</i> as lawful Bishop.
Among the Moderns, <i>Onuphrius Panvinius</i>, in his Lives of the Popes,
printed in 1557. some Years before the Discovery of <i>Felix</i>’s Body,
calls <i>Novatian</i> the First Antipope, and <i>Felix</i> the Second. But his
Book was prohibited in 1583. the Year after the Second Canonization
of <i>Felix</i>. The Writers, who came after, took Warning; and such
of them as thought it base to concur in deceiving Mankind, since it
was not safe to undeceive them, chose to wave this Subject, but not
without giving some broad Hints of what they believed in their
Hearts. Thus F. <i>Labbé</i><a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c015'><sup>[807]</sup></a>, and Cardinal <i>Bona</i><a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c015'><sup>[808]</sup></a>, take no notice of
this <i>Felix</i>, but call Pope <i>Felix</i>, who was raised to the See of <i>Rome</i>
in 485. the Second Pope of that Name. <i>Felix</i> I. was martyred under
<i>Aurelian</i> in 274. as we have related elsewhere<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c015'><sup>[809]</sup></a>. F. <i>Labbé</i>, at the
Death of <i>Felix</i> II. which happened in 492. adds, that he was the Third
of that Name, according to <i>Baronius</i><a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c015'><sup>[810]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Acknowleged as such<br/>by some</i> Roman<br/><i>Catholic Writers</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Had <i>Felix</i> never been canonized,
no Man would have been so regardless of his own Reputation
as to undertake his Defence; but <i>Gregory</i> having declared him a
Saint, and, by such a Declaration, linked his Cause with Infallibility
in a most essential Point, the hired Champions of that See found themselves
under an indispensable Obligation of entering the Lists; which
I need not say they have done to no Purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Emperor under-<br/>takes the establishing<br/>of</i> Arianism.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>The Fall of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who was at the Head of the Orthodox
Party, inspired the Emperor with great Hopes of succeeding
in the Design he had formed of utterly abolishing the Orthodox Faith:
he found there were but few Bishops whose Virtue was Proof against
the Frowns and Resentment of the Court. In the Council held at
<i>Arles</i> in 353. they had all to a Man chosen rather to communicate
with the <i>Arians</i>, than be driven from their Sees: in that which was
convened Two Years after, at <i>Milan</i>, only Three Bishops were found,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Dionysius</i> Bishop of that City, <i>Lucifer</i> of <i>Cagliari</i>, and <i>Eusebius</i>
of <i>Vercelli</i>, who, equally unmoved by Threats and Promises,
had maintained the Truth with the Loss of their Dignity. The Example
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> had been followed by the far greater
Part of the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>. But what above all encouraged the Emperor
to pursue the Scheme he had so much at heart, was the Fall of
the celebrated <i>Osius</i> Bishop of <i>Cordoua</i>, in the Hundredth Year of his
Age, and Sixty-second of his Episcopacy. As the Name of <i>Osius</i> is
one of the most famous in the Ecclesiastical History of those Times,
and his Fall is alleged by the Antients as a memorable Instance of the
Weakness of human Nature, however strengthened and improved by
a long Practice of the most eminent Virtues, a succinct Account of so
remarkable an Event will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Reader,
or thought foreign to the Subject in hand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A succinct Account<br/>of the Life of</i> Osius<br/><i>Bishop of</i> Cordoua.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Osius</i> was a Native of <i>Spain</i><a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c015'><sup>[811]</sup></a>, born, according to some, in <i>Cordoua</i>,
about the Year 256. and raised, in regard of his extraordinary
Merit, to the See of that City in 295<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c015'><sup>[812]</sup></a>. He was even then conspicuous
for the Firmness of his Faith, and the Purity of his Life, says
<i>Sozomen</i><a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c015'><sup>[813]</sup></a>. <i>Athanasius</i>, who was well acquainted with him, speaks
of him with the greatest Respect and Esteem, calling him a Man truly
holy, according to the <i>Greek</i> Signification of his Name; one in whose
Conduct even his most inveterate Enemies could discover nothing that
was not commendable, his Life being irreprehensible, and his Reputation
unspotted<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c015'><sup>[814]</sup></a>. <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c015'><sup>[815]</sup></a>, and <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c015'><sup>[816]</sup></a>, extol him on Account
of his extraordinary Prudence, Wisdom, and Learning, which
gave great Weight to his Opinion in the many Councils at which he
assisted, and often presided. In the Year 300. he was present
at the Council of <i>Eliberis</i>, or <i>Illeberis</i>, in <i>Spain</i>, famous for the
Severity of its Canons; and, in all Likelihood, made even then a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>considerable Figure; since, in the Acts of that Council, he is named
in the Second Place after <i>Felix</i> of <i>Acci</i>, now <i>Guadix</i>, in <i>Andalusia</i>,
who probably presided<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c015'><sup>[817]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is imprisoned<br/>under</i> Maximian <i>for<br/>the Confession of<br/>the Faith</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Three Years after broke out the Persecution
of <i>Maximian Hercules</i>, in which <i>Osius</i> distinguished himself by his
Zeal, his Constancy, and his Sufferings; for, having with great Intrepidity
confessed his Faith before the Pagan Magistrates, he was by
them imprisoned, and kept under a very close and painful Confinement
for the Space of Two Years, that is, from the Year 303. to 305.
when, upon the Abdication of <i>Maximian</i> and <i>Dioclesian</i>, he was
set at Liberty by <i>Constantius Chlorus</i>, the Father of <i>Constantine the
Great</i><a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c015'><sup>[818]</sup></a>. He is honoured by <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c015'><sup>[819]</sup></a>, by the Council of <i>Sardica</i>,
and by most of the Antients, with the Title of <i>Confessor</i>, which was
given to such as had suffered Imprisonment, Torments, or Exile, but
had not died, for the Confession of the Faith. He was highly esteemed
and revered by <i>Constantine</i>, not only as a Confessor, but as a Person
of extraordinary Wisdom and Probity<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c015'><sup>[820]</sup></a>; whence he is thought to
have been one of the Prelates whom that Prince consulted in 311<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c015'><sup>[821]</sup></a>.
and kept with him to instruct him in the Mysteries of the Christian
Religion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He instructs</i><br/>Constantine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Some think that <i>Osius</i> was meant by the <i>Egyptian</i> Priest
come from <i>Spain</i>, to whom <i>Zosimus</i> ascribes the Change made by
<i>Constantine</i> in point of Religion<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c015'><sup>[822]</sup></a>. The Church of <i>Cordoua</i> was, out
of Regard to him, enriched by <i>Constantine</i> with many valuable Presents,
whence he is said to have been very rich<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c015'><sup>[823]</sup></a>. But what Use he
made of his Wealth we may learn from <i>Athanasius</i>, who assures us,
that no one in Want ever applied to him without being relieved, and
receiving the Supply he demanded<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c015'><sup>[824]</sup></a>. In the famous Dispute, which
I have taken notice of in its proper Place, between <i>Cæcilianus</i> and the
<i>Donatists</i> of <i>Africa</i>, <i>Osius</i> undertook, with great Zeal, the Defence
of the former, and prevailed in the End upon <i>Constantine</i> to espouse
his Cause, and declare against the <i>Donatists</i><a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c015'><sup>[825]</sup></a>, whom he thenceforth
punished with great Severity, taking their Churches from them, and
sending the most obstinate among them into Exile. <i>Constantine</i> being
become Master of the East in the Year 323. his first Care was to put an
End to the unhappy Divisions that reigned in those Churches about
the Celebration of <i>Easter</i>, and some other controverted Points. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is sent by him<br/>to compose some<br/>Disputes there.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>this View he dispatched <i>Osius</i> into the East, who, upon his Arrival
there, summoned a Council to meet at <i>Alexandria</i>, which, under
his Influence, condemned the Heresy of <i>Sabellius</i>, put a Stop to the
Schism of one <i>Colluthus</i>, and greatly allayed the Animosity of the
contending Parties about the Day on which <i>Easter</i> was to be kept<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c015'><sup>[826]</sup></a>.
On his Return to Court, the Account he gave of the <i>Arians</i>, whose
Heresy he had endeavoured in vain to suppress, made so deep an Impression
in the Mind of the Emperor, that, for a long time, he continued
highly prejudiced against them<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c015'><sup>[827]</sup></a>. It was at the Suggestion of
<i>Osius</i> that <i>Constantine</i> assembled the Council of <i>Nice</i> in 325. at which
he assisted, and distinguished himself above the rest<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c015'><sup>[828]</sup></a>; for of all Councils
he was the Head and Leader, as <i>Athanasius</i> styles him<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c015'><sup>[829]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He assists at the<br/>Council of</i> Nice <i>and<br/>draws up the</i> Nicene<br/><i>Creed</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  By him
was worded and drawn up the famous <i>Nicene</i> Symbol or Creed, as
we are told in express Terms by <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c015'><sup>[830]</sup></a>. He presided at the
Council of <i>Sardica</i>, which, at his Request, was assembled by the
Emperor <i>Constans</i> in 347<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c015'><sup>[831]</sup></a>. From that Council he retired to his Bishoprick,
and continued there undisturbed till the Year 355. when <i>Constantius</i>
seeing himself Master of the West, as well as of the East, undertook
to oblige all the Bishops to condemn <i>Athanasius</i>, whose Cause
was looked upon as inseparable from that of the Orthodox Faith. As
<i>Osius</i> had on all Occasions declared highly in his Favour, and the
Example of a Prelate so venerable for his Age, for the glorious Title
of Confessor, and the Figure he had made for many Years in the
Church, greatly prejudiced the World against the Enemies of the persecuted
Bishop, the Emperor resolved to deprive, if possible, the Orthodox
Party of so powerful a Support. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantius <i>attempts<br/>in vain to gain him<br/>over to the</i> Arian<br/><i>Party</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With this View he ordered
<i>Osius</i> to repair to <i>Milan</i>, where the Court then was, well knowing
that he was not, like most other Bishops, to be terrified with threatening
Letters. <i>Osius</i>, in Compliance with the Emperor’s Orders, set
out without Delay from <i>Cordoua</i>, notwithstanding his great Age; and,
arriving at <i>Milan</i>, was there received by the Emperor with all the
Respect that was due to the <i>Father of Bishops</i>, as he was styled. <i>Constantius</i>
entertained him for some Days with the utmost Civility,
hoping by that means to bring him into his Views; but he no sooner
named <i>Athanasius</i> to him, than the zealous Prelate, well knowing
the Drift of his Discourse, and armed against all Temptations, interrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>him with declaring, that he was ready to sacrifice not one, but
a Thousand Lives, in so just a Cause; nay, he even reprimanded the
Emperor with great Freedom, who, out of an awful Reverence for a
Prelate of his Years, Authority, and Figure, heard him with great Patience,
and not only forbore offering him any Violence, but gave him
Leave to return unmolested to his See<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c015'><sup>[832]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His second Attempt<br/>to gain him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The mild Treatment <i>Osius</i> met with gave great Uneasiness to the
<i>Arian</i> Party, especially to the Two Bishops, <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>,
who thereupon never ceased soliciting the Emperor to proceed with
Vigour against the only Man, who, they said, was capable of obstructing
his great and pious Designs. They were powerfully seconded by
the Eunuchs, who prevailed in the End upon the Emperor, as they
bore a great Sway at Court, to try anew the Firmness and Constancy
of so celebrated a Champion. <i>Constantius</i> therefore writ several Letters
to him, treating him in some with great Respect, and styling
him his Father, but menacing him in others, and naming to him the
Bishops, whom he had banished for refusing to condemn a Man whom
most Bishops, and several Councils, had already condemned<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c015'><sup>[833]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Letter to the<br/>Emperor.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Osius</i>,
inflexible and unmoved, answered the Emperor by a Letter worthy of
himself, and the great Reputation he had acquired. It has been conveyed
to us by <i>Athanasius</i>, and nothing can be said stronger in that
Bishop’s Defence; for he there shews unanswerably, that, whatever
Crimes might be alleged against him, his only Guilt was a steady Adherence
to the Faith of <i>Nice</i><a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c015'><sup>[834]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is sent to</i><br/>Sirmium.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Constantius</i>, without hearkening
to the Reasons he urged in Justification of his own and <i>Athanasius</i>’s
Conduct, without paying the least Regard to the earnest Prayers
and Intreaties, to the paternal Exhortations and Admonitions, of so
venerable a Prelate, ordered him to quit his See forthwith, and repair
to <i>Sirmium</i>, where he was kept a whole Year in a kind of Exile.
But, unaffected with the many Hardships he suffered there, with the
Loss of his Dignity, with the inhuman Treatment of his Relations,
who were all persecuted, stripped of their Estates, and reduced to Beggary
on his Account, <i>Osius</i> still stood up in Defence of <i>Athanasius</i>,
still rejected with Indignation the Proposals of his Enemies<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c015'><sup>[835]</sup></a>, striving
to induce him at least to communicate with them. They therefore
resolved to proceed to open Force, and either to gain over to their
Party a Man of his Figure and Rank, or, by removing him out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Way, to deprive the Orthodox of their main Support<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c015'><sup>[836]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Confined and racked.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Accordingly,
with the Emperor’s Consent and Approbation, they caused him first
to be closely confined, and afterwards to be cruelly beaten; and lastly
to be put to the Rack, and most inhumanly tortured, as if he had
been the worst of Criminals<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c015'><sup>[837]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He yields at last.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Even against such exquisite Torments
the Firmness of his Mind was proof for some time; but the Weakness
of his Body obliged him in a manner to yield at last, and communicate
with <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i><a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c015'><sup>[838]</sup></a>. <i>Athanasius</i> seems to insinuate in
some Places, that he signed his Condemnation<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c015'><sup>[839]</sup></a>; but in another he
expresly denies it<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c015'><sup>[840]</sup></a>. <i>Sulpitius Severus</i> thinks he was guilty of no
other Crime but that of communicating with the <i>Arians</i><a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c015'><sup>[841]</sup></a>. <i>Athanasius</i>
only says, that he consented to communicate with <i>Ursacius</i> and
<i>Valens</i><a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c015'><sup>[842]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He signs the</i> Sirmian<br/><i>Confession of Faith</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, that he did not stop there, but signed the <i>Arian</i>
Confession of <i>Sirmium</i>, is but too manifest from several unexceptionable
and contemporary Writers. <i>Ph&oelig;badius</i> Bishop of <i>Agen</i>, in
<i>France</i>, in his Answer written at this very Time to the <i>Arians</i>, bragging
that their Doctrine had been approved and embraced by the great
<i>Osius</i>, allows the Fact; but adds, that he was induced thereunto by
Force, and not Conviction<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c015'><sup>[843]</sup></a>. <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>, who writ
at the same time, say, that <i>Osius</i> set his Hand, but never yielded
his Heart, to the <i>Arian</i> Impiety<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c015'><sup>[844]</sup></a>. Nay, <i>Hilarius</i> Bishop of <i>Poitiers</i>
supposes the <i>Sirmian</i> Confession of Faith to have been drawn up by
<i>Osius</i> and <i>Potamus</i>; for he often calls it, <i>The Heresy, the Blasphemies,

for opposing the great <i>Transgressor</i> Osius<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c015'><sup>[849]</sup></a>. <i>Potamus</i>, whom
I have mentioned above, was Bishop of <i>Lisbone</i>, and a most sanguine
Stickler for the Orthodox Party; but upon the Emperor’s yielding
to him some Lands of the Imperial Demesne, that lay very convenient
for him, he changed Sides, and became a most zealous

pleases himself with ridiculing, and indeed very justly, this
and several other Conversions, greatly boasted by the <i>Arians</i>; but
he must give me Leave to put him in mind, that he ridicules, at the
same time, the many Conversions which his Church is constantly
boasting, since most of them, especially those thus made in the new
World, have been owing to Arguments of the same Nature as that
of <i>Osius</i>, and other <i>Arian</i> Proselytes, and were not perhaps at all
more sincere. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hilarius <i>not well<br/>informed as to the<br/>Circumstances of his<br/>Fall</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Hilarius</i>, Bishop of <i>Poitiers</i>, who lived at this time
in Exile, amidst the <i>Arians</i> in <i>Phrygia</i>, seems not to be well informed
as to the Circumstances of the Fall of <i>Osius</i>; else he had
made some Allowance for the barbarous and inhuman Treatment the
unhappy Prelate met with, and not reflected on him with so much
Bitterness and Severity, saying, that it had pleased God to prolong
his Life till he fell, that the World might know what he had been
before he fell<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c015'><sup>[856]</sup></a>. That a Man in the Hundredth Year of his Age
should yield to most exquisite and repeated Torments, is not at all
to be wondered at; and therefore had <i>Hilarius</i> been better informed,
he had rather pitied than reproached him. But the <i>Arians</i>, among
whom he lived, took care to conceal whatever could any ways depreciate
their boasted Victory: at least that <i>Hilarius</i> was a Stranger
to what <i>Osius</i> had suffered, is manifest, from his ascribing the Fall of
that great Prelate not to the Cruelty of his Enemies, but to the too
great Love he had for his Sepulchre<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c015'><sup>[857]</sup></a>, meaning, I suppose, the Desire
he had of dying in his native Country, and not in Exile.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He is restored<br/>to his See.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span><i>Osius</i> having thus gratified the Emperor, by communicating with
the <i>Arians</i>, and signing the <i>Sirmian</i> Confession of Faith, he was
immediately reinstated in his See, and suffered to return to his native
Country, where he gave some Trouble, it seems, to the Orthodox
Bishops; for <i>Gregory</i> Bishop of <i>Elvira</i> is highly commended
by <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i>, who lived then in Exile, <i>for opposing the
Transgressor</i> Osius, as I have observed above. The unfortunate Prelate
did not live long after his Fall, but died in the Latter-end of
the same Year 357. according to the most probable Opinion. He did
not forget the Crime he had committed, says <i>Athanasius</i><a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c015'><sup>[858]</sup></a>; but
grievously complained, at the Point of Death, of the Violence that
had been offered him, anathematized the Heresy of <i>Arius</i>, and exhorted,
as by his last Will, all Mankind to reject it<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c015'><sup>[859]</sup></a>. To his Repentance
<i>Athanasius</i>, no doubt, alludes, where he writes, that <i>Osius</i>
yielded only for a time<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c015'><sup>[860]</sup></a>; which he says of no other, not even of
<i>Liberius</i>. As for the Account, which some Writers give of his tragical
End<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c015'><sup>[861]</sup></a>, it is not worthy of Notice. The <i>Greek</i> Church honours
him as a Saint, and his Festival is kept on the 27th of <i>August</i><a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c015'><sup>[862]</sup></a>; but
they are certainly mistaken in supposing him to have died in Banishment.
The Case of <i>Osius</i> deserves, without all Doubt, to be greatly
pitied. But it would be still more worthy of our Pity and Compassion,
had he been himself an Enemy to all Persecution. But it must
be observed, that he was the Author and Promoter of the First Christian
Persecution. For it was he who first stirred up <i>Constantine</i>
against the <i>Donatists</i>; many of whom were sent into Exile, and
some even sentenced to Death, nay, and led to the Place of Execution.
I dare not interpret the very severe Treatment he met with, or
his Fall and Apostasy, as a Judgment; but cannot help thinking him,
on that Consideration, less worthy of our Compassion and Concern,
than a Man of his Years and Merit would otherwise have been.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Constantius <i>appoints<br/>a Council to meet at</i><br/>Nicomedia;</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Constantius</i>, having thus gained over to the Heterodox Party the
celebrated Bishop of <i>Cordoua</i>, and sent those into Exile, whom he apprehended
most capable of traversing his Design, resolved to assemble
a Council, not doubting but he should be able, by some means or
other, to prevail upon the Members, that composed it, to approve
and embrace the Doctrine, which he was labouring with indefatigable
Pains to establish. Accordingly he writ to the chief Bishops of each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Province, injoining them to meet in the Name of the rest, at an
appointed Time, in the City of <i>Nicomedia</i><a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c015'><sup>[863]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which City is destroyed by an Earthquake</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In Compliance with
his Orders the Bishops immediately set out; but, while they were on
the Road, they were stopped by the News that was brought them
of the utter Destruction of the City of <i>Nicomedia</i> by a sudden and
most dreadful Earthquake. This public Calamity happened on the
24th of <i>August</i> 358<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c015'><sup>[864]</sup></a>. and the <i>Arians</i>, in the Account which they
transmitted of it to Court, assured the Emperor, that several Bishops,
who were for <i>Consubstantiality</i>, had been buried under the Ruins of the
great Church<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c015'><sup>[865]</sup></a>. It was probably, by this Account, that <i>Philostorgius</i>
was deceived and misled, when he writ, that Fifteen Bishops, who
were all Defenders of <i>Consubstantiality</i>, were crushed to Pieces by
the Fall of the Church, together with <i>Cecrops</i> Bishop of the City<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c015'><sup>[866]</sup></a>.
But <i>Sozomen</i> assures us, that, when the Church fell, there was not a
single Person in it; and that Two Bishops only perished in the Earthquake,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Cecrops</i>, who was an <i>Arian</i>, and a Bishop of <i>Bosporus</i><a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c015'><sup>[867]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council ap-<br/>pointed to meet at</i> Nice.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This Misfortune obliged the Emperor to change the Place of the
Council; and accordingly Letters were immediately dispatched to all
the Bishops, ordering them to repair to <i>Nice</i>, which City was suggested
to him by <i>Basilius</i>, the <i>Semi-Arian</i> Bishop of <i>Ancyra</i>, with a
Design, says <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c015'><sup>[868]</sup></a>, to eclipse the Glory and Authority of the
First Council by the Confusion of Two. Be that as it will, the Bishops
were ordered to meet there early in the Summer of the Year
359. Such as were not in a Condition to undertake such a Journey,
on account of their Age or Infirmities, were to send Priests or Deacons,
as their Deputies, to vote and act in their Name; and the Council
was strictly injoined to transmit to the Emperor such Decrees as
they should enact, that he might examine them, and see whether they
were agreeable to Scripture: for this Purpose Ten Deputies were to
be appointed by the Bishops of the East, and the like Number by
those of the West<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c015'><sup>[869]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Two Councils<br/>appointed to meet<br/>instead of one.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But while the World was expecting to see a
second Oecumenical Council assembled at <i>Nice</i>, the Emperor all on a
sudden changed his Mind, and instead of one, resolved to convene
Two, the one in the East, and the other in the West<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c015'><sup>[870]</sup></a>. This Change
was owing to the Intrigues of the <i>Anomeans</i>, or <i>Pure Arians</i>, who,
finding the far greater Part of the Bishops either for the Orthodox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Faith of <i>Nice</i>, or, the <i>Semi-Arian</i>, as established in a Council at <i>Antioch</i>,
concluded, that there would be no Means to divert them, when
assembled together, from condemning their Doctrine; whereas if they
were divided, they did not despair of being able to manage both
Assemblies, or at least one of the Two<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c015'><sup>[871]</sup></a>. This Design of dividing
the Council they privately imparted to the Eunuch <i>Eusebius</i>, their
great Friend, and the Emperor’s chief Favourite, who, highly applauding
the Scheme, took upon him to get it approved by <i>Constantius</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Occasion of this<br/>Change.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  And this he easily effected, by representing, that a General Council
would put the Bishops to greater Trouble and Inconveniences than
most of them could well bear, and, at the same time, the Treasury
to an immense Charge; for on such Occasions their Expences were
defrayed by the Emperor<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c015'><sup>[872]</sup></a>. He therefore advised him to assemble
Two Councils at the same time, one in the East, and the other in the
West, which, he said, would be less troublesome to the Bishops, and
less expensive to the Exchequer. To these Reasons <i>Constantius</i> acquiesced;
but, as he was a zealous <i>Semi-Arian</i>, <i>Eusebius</i> kept him
in the Dark, as to the true Motive of such a Change. Thus was
<i>Constantius</i>, and thus have many Princes been, since his Time, led,
as it were, hoodwinked, by some in whom they reposed an intire Confidence,
into Measures tending to promote Designs quite opposite to
their own.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rimini <i>chosen for the<br/>Western Bishops</i>;</div>

<p class='c001'>This Point being settled, to the great Satisfaction of the <i>Anomeans</i>,
<i>Ariminum</i>, now <i>Rimini</i>, on the <i>Adriatic</i> Sea, was thought the most
proper Place for the Western Bishops to meet at. But the City of <i>Nice</i>,
where the General Council was to assemble, having suffered much by
the late Earthquake, the Emperor desired the Eastern Bishops might
not meet there, but in whatever other Place they should agree among
themselves to be the most proper and convenient<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c015'><sup>[873]</sup></a>. This <i>Theodoret</i>
ascribes to a particular Providence, that would not suffer the
great Council of <i>Nice</i> to be ever confounded with a Conventicle of
Heretics<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c015'><sup>[874]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and</i> Seleucia <i>in</i><br/>Isauria <i>for those of<br/>the East</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As the Bishops could not agree about the Place, and it
was not at all probable they should, the Emperor, by the Advice of
a few, who were then with him at <i>Sirmium</i>, named the City of <i>Seleucia</i>
in <i>Isauria</i><a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c015'><sup>[875]</sup></a>. And now that the Place was settled for both
Councils, <i>Constantius</i> issued an Order, injoining not only the chief
Bishops of each Province, as he had done the Year before, but all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>without Exception, to repair to one of the Two<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c015'><sup>[876]</sup></a>; nay, he dispatched
Officers into the Provinces, with a strict Charge to see his Order
punctually obeyed, and put in Execution<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c015'><sup>[877]</sup></a>. The Bishops therefore
set out from all Parts; the public Carriages, Roads, and Houses, were
every-where crouded with them; which gave great Offence to the
Catechumens, and no small Diversion to the Pagans, who thought it
equally strange and ridiculous, that Men, who had been brought up
from their Infancy in the Christian Religion, and whose Business it
was to instruct others in that Belief, should be constantly hurrying, in
their old Age, from one Place to another, to know what they themselves
should believe<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c015'><sup>[878]</sup></a>. <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> complains, that the
necessary Funds for the Maintenance of the public Carriages were
quite drained and exhausted, by the roaming about of the Christian
Bishops<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c015'><sup>[879]</sup></a>. Their Charges were defrayed by the Emperor, as I have
observed above; but the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i> and <i>Britain</i>, that they
might be the more independent, insisted upon travelling at their own
Expence; only Three of the latter, not having wherewithal to support
themselves, chose rather to be obliged to the Emperor than burdensome
to their Collegues, who generously offered to contribute to
their Maintenance, every one according to his Ability<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c015'><sup>[880]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Western Bishops, that is, those of <i>Illyricum</i>, <i>Italy</i>, <i>Africa</i>,
<i>Spain</i>, <i>Gaul</i>, and <i>Britain</i>, being assembled at <i>Rimini</i>, in all 400
and upwards<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c015'><sup>[881]</sup></a>, the Emperor writ to <i>Taurus</i>, the <i>Præfectus Prætorio</i>
of <i>Italy</i>, charging him to be present at all the Debates, and
not to suffer the Bishops to separate, till, in Points of Faith, they had
all agreed: if he succeeded therein, he was to be rewarded with the
Consular Dignity<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c015'><sup>[882]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Emperor’s Letter<br/>to the Western<br/>Bishops.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At the same time he writ to the Bishops, injoining
them to treat only of such Matters as related to the Faith,
Unity, and Order of the Church, and forbidding them to meddle,
on any Pretence whatsoever, with what concerned the Eastern Bishops,
who, he said, would take care to settle their own Affairs,
since they were met for that Purpose<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c015'><sup>[883]</sup></a>. This was to prevent their
entering upon the Cause of <i>Athanasius</i>, whom he well knew the
Western Bishops would have declared innocent. The Emperor’s Letter
is dated the 27th of May 359<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c015'><sup>[884]</sup></a>. At this Council <i>Restitutus</i> Bishop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of <i>Carthage</i> is supposed to have presided, as he was, both for
Piety and Learning, the most conspicuous in the Assembly. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Arians <i>propose<br/>a new Confession<br/>drawn up at</i><br/>Sirmium;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At their
first Meeting, the Two <i>Arian</i> Bishops, <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>, appeared
with a Paper in their Hands, containing a new Confession of Faith,
composed lately at <i>Sirmium</i> by the Emperor, by a small Number of
<i>Arian</i> and <i>Semi-Arian</i> Bishops, and several Presbyters and Deacons,
who, after a Debate, which lasted the whole Day, had at length
agreed to suppress the Word <i>Consubstantial</i>; and introduce the Word
<i>like</i> in its room; so that the Son was no more to be said <i>consubstantial</i>,
but <i>like to the Father in all Things</i>; the Three last Words <i>Constantius</i>
added, and, by obliging all who were present to sign them,
defeated, say the <i>Semi-Arians</i>, the wicked Designs of the Heretics,
meaning the <i>Pure Arians</i><a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c015'><sup>[885]</sup></a>. However, excepting those Words, the
whole Confession was thought to favour their Doctrine<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c015'><sup>[886]</sup></a>; whence the
<i>Semi-Arians</i> held out till Night, when the Emperor, well satisfied
with the Words <i>like in all things</i>, obliged them to sign it. This
Confession of Faith was drawn up, and signed, on the Eve of <i>Pentecost</i><a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c015'><sup>[887]</sup></a>,
that is, on the 22d or 23d of <i>May</i> 359<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c015'><sup>[888]</sup></a>. <i>Easter</i> having
fallen that Year on the 4th of <i>April</i><a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c015'><sup>[889]</sup></a><a id='rN17' /><a href='#fN17' class='c015'><sup>[N17]</sup></a>. <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i> read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>it to the Council, adding, when they had done, that it had been approved
of by the Emperor, and therefore that they ought all to be
satisfied with it, without recurring to any other Councils or Creeds,
without demanding any other Confession of the Heretics, or inquiring
too narrowly into their Doctrine and Opinions, which would be
attended with much Trouble, endless Disputes, and eternal Divisions;
that the Catholic Truths, which all Men were bound to believe, ought
not to be darkened with Metaphysical Terms, but expressed by Words,
which all Men understood; and, lastly, that it was quite idle to
quarrel and make so much Noise about a Word (meaning the Word
<i>consubstantial</i>) which none of the inspired Writers had thought fit to
make use of in explaining the Mysteries of our holy Religion<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c015'><sup>[890]</sup></a>. What
Answer the Council returned, I can find no-where recorded. But a
Motion being made soon after to condemn and anathematize the
<i>Arian</i> and all other Heresies, <i>Ursacius</i> and his Party opposed it; which
alarmed the Orthodox Bishops, concluding from thence, that whatever
Expressions they made use of, their Belief was different from that of
the Catholic Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which is rejected</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They therefore resolved to hearken to them
no longer; and accordingly, without the least Regard to their Remonstrances
and Protestations, they condemned, with one Consent,
all Heresies in general, and that of <i>Arius</i> in particular; declared heretical
the Confession of Faith presented by <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>;
confirmed that of <i>Nice</i>, and ordered the Word <i>consubstantial</i> to be
retained, since the true Meaning of it might be sufficiently gathered
from several Passages in Scripture<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c015'><sup>[891]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and they condemned<br/>and deposed</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They did not stop here; but,
transported with Zeal on the <i>Arians</i> attempting to impose upon them
by a Second Confession of Faith, they declared them all, and their
Leaders <i>Ursacius</i>, <i>Valens</i>, <i>Germinius</i>, and <i>Caius</i>, by Name, ignorant
and deceitful Men, Impostors, Heretics, deposed them in the Council,
and signed all to a Man this Declaration on the 21st of <i>July</i> of the
present Year 359<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c015'><sup>[892]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN17'>N17</a>. It was signed by the few Bishops,
who were present, and by a good Number
of Presbyters and Deacons. The Bishops
were <i>Marcus</i> of <i>Arethusa</i>, <i>George</i>, who
had been intruded into the See of <i>Alexandria</i>,
<i>Basilius</i> of <i>Ancyra</i>, <i>Germinius</i> of <i>Sirmium</i>,
<i>Hypatianus</i> of <i>Heraclea</i>, <i>Valens</i>, <i>Ursacius</i>,
and <i>Pancratius</i> of <i>Pelusium</i><a id='rN17.1' /><a href='#fN17.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
<i>Valens</i>, in signing it, added to his Name
these Words; <i>I believe the Son to be like
to the Father</i>. He was unwilling to acknowlege
the Son like to the Father <i>in all
things</i>, agreeably to the Confession, which
he was to sign, and therefore suppressed
these Words. But the Emperor insisting
upon his adding them, he took his Will for
the Rule of his Faith, and added them accordingly.
<i>Basilius</i> of <i>Ancyra</i>, suspecting
some Meaning contrary to the Doctrine
which he held, to lie concealed and disguised
under those Words, declared, that
he understood by them a Likeness in <i>Substance</i>,
in <i>Existence</i>, and in <i>Essence</i>; and
that he signed in this, and no other Sense,
the present Symbol. Not satisfied with
this Declaration, he writ, some time after,
an Exposition of the Faith that was professed
by him, and the other <i>Semi-Arian</i>
Bishops. This Exposition is, by <i>Epiphanius</i>,
styled a Letter, and was placed by him
after the circular Letter of the Council of
<i>Ancyra</i>. The present Confession of <i>Sirmium</i>
is commonly styled the Third, but
was, properly speaking, the Fourth: For
before this, Three different Symbols had
been composed at <i>Sirmium</i>; <i>viz.</i> one intirely
Orthodox, in 351. another altogether
<i>Arian</i>, in 357. a Third <i>Semi-Arian</i>, in 358.
and the present in 359. The Second <i>Liberius</i>
signed at <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, and the Third at

<p class='c001'>With this Act they put an End to the Sessions, and immediately
dispatched Ten Deputies to acquaint the Emperor with what had passed,
pursuant to his express Command. The like Number was sent by the
<i>Arians</i>, who had assisted at the Council. These, traveling with great
Expedition, arrived at <i>Constantinople</i>, where the Court then was,
some time before the others; and, being immediately admitted to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Emperor, they prejudiced him to such a Degree against the Orthodox
Party, that he would not so much as see their Deputies, pretending
to be wholly taken up with the Affairs of the State. They were therefore
obliged to deliver the Letter, which the Council had written on
this Occasion, to one of his Ministers<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c015'><sup>[893]</sup></a>. They expected every Day to
be admitted to an Audience, or, at least, to receive an Answer, and
be dismissed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who leaves</i><br/>Constantinople<br/><i>without seeing them</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But, after they had been thus kept for some time in
Expectation, the Emperor all on a sudden left <i>Constantinople</i>, in order
to head his Army against the <i>Barbarians</i>, who had broken into the
Empire. He was no sooner gone than one of the Ministers came to
acquaint them, that it was the Emperor’s Pleasure they should repair
forthwith to <i>Adrianople</i>, and there wait his Return<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c015'><sup>[894]</sup></a>. However,
before he set out, he writ to the Council, giving them notice of
his sudden Departure from <i>Constantinople</i>; and alleging, by way
of Excuse for not having seen or heard their Deputies, the present
Situation of public Affairs, which had engrossed his whole
Attention, whereas, the discussing and settling of spiritual Affairs
required a Mind quite free and disengaged from all worldly
Cares. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He endeavours to tire<br/>their Patience with<br/>Delays.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He concluded his short Letter with intreating them not

with them, Matters of so great Importance to the Church,

<i>Constantius</i>, as <i>Athanasius</i> styles him<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c015'><sup>[896]</sup></a>, was to tire out the Bishops
with such Delays, hoping they would, in the End, chuse rather to
sign the last <i>Sirmian</i> Confession, which he was bent upon establishing
in the room of the <i>Nicene</i>, than to be long kept, as it were, in Exile,
at a Distance from their Sees<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c015'><sup>[897]</sup></a>. But this he could not compass for the
present, the Bishops declaring, in their Answer to his Letter, that they
could not, and hoped they never should, upon any Consideration
whatsoever, depart from what they had so unanimously settled and
decreed<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c015'><sup>[898]</sup></a>. <i>Socrates</i> writes, that the Bishops, after having waited
some time in vain for the Emperor’s Answer to their Letter, left
<i>Rimini</i>, and retired to their respective Sees<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c015'><sup>[899]</sup></a>. And here he ends his
Account of that Council. It were greatly to be wished, that nothing
else could be said of it; but several contemporary and unexceptionable
Writers, and <i>Hilarius</i> among the rest<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c015'><sup>[900]</sup></a>, assure us, that <i>Constantius</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><i>changed at last the Faith of the Western Bishops into Impiety</i>. Of
this deplorable Change they give us the following Account.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Their Deputies ordered<br/>to</i> Nice <i>in</i> Thrace;</div>

<p class='c001'>The <i>Arians</i>, taking Occasion from the last Letter of the Bishops at
<i>Rimini</i> to incense <i>Constantius</i> against them, prevailed upon him to
order their Deputies to a City in <i>Thrace</i>, known at that Time by the
Name of <i>Nice</i>, but formerly called <i>Ostudizus</i>, and placed by <i>Sanson</i>
a few Leagues to the East of <i>Adrianople</i>. This Place they chose, that
the Symbol, which they designed to impose upon them, might be
confounded by the ignorant People with that of the great Council of
<i>Nice</i> in <i>Bithynia</i><a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c015'><sup>[901]</sup></a>. The Deputies no sooner arrived there, than a
Confession of Faith was proposed to them intirely agreeable to the
last made at <i>Sirmium</i>, except that in this new Creed the Son was declared
<i>like to the Father</i>, without the Addition of the Words <i>in all
Things</i>. This they rejected at first with great Resolution and Intrepidity;
but the <i>Arians</i> were no less resolute, and therefore left nothing
unattempted they could think of to carry their Point<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c015'><sup>[902]</sup></a>. But finding
Hope and Fear, Threats and Promises, equally ineffectual, they proceeded
at last to open Force and Violence<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c015'><sup>[903]</sup></a>. What Kind of Violence
was employed against them, the Author does not tell us; but <i>Marcellinus</i>
and <i>Faustinus</i> ascribe their retracting what they had declared
to be holy, and approving what they had condemned as impious, to
the Love of their Sees, and the Dread they were in of being driven
from them<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c015'><sup>[904]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>where they sign the</i><br/>Sirmian <i>Confession</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Be that as it will, it is certain, that they yielded at
last; that they accepted and signed, without the least Limitation or
Restriction, the above-mentioned Confession of Faith; consented to
the Suppression of the Word <i>Consubstantial</i>; declared void and null
all the Acts and Proceedings of the Council of <i>Rimini</i>; anathematized,
as heretical, all Opinions contrary to the Doctrine contained in the
said Confession; and, finally, admitted to their Communion <i>Ursacius</i>,
<i>Valens</i>, <i>Germinius</i>, and <i>Caius</i>, whom they had not long before
deposed as Heretics<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c015'><sup>[905]</sup></a>. <i>Restitutus</i>, Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, and one
of the most eminent Prelates at that Time in the Church, signed the
first, and the other Deputies after him, according to the Dignity of
their Sees. The Emperor, transported with Joy at the News of their
Compliance, which he looked upon as a signal Victory, gave them
immediately Leave to return to <i>Rimini</i>. At the same time he wrote
to <i>Taurus</i>, charging him anew not to suffer the Bishops to depart till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>they had all signed the same Confession of Faith, and impowering
him to send into Exile such as by their Obstinacy should distinguish
themselves above the rest, provided they were not above Fifteen in
Number<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c015'><sup>[906]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantius <i>orders<br/>the Bishops at</i> Rimini<br/><i>to suppress the Words</i><br/>Substance <i>and</i><br/>Consubstantial.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
 He likewise writ to the Bishops, commanding them,
on Pain of incurring his Indignation, to suppress for ever the Words
<i>Substance</i> and <i>Consubstantial</i>, severely reprimanding them for presuming
to depose <i>Ursacius</i> and his Collegues, and assuring them, that
they should not be allowed to return to their Sees, till they had intitled
themselves to his Favour by an intire and unreserved Compliance
with his Will<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c015'><sup>[907]</sup></a>. To this Letter the <i>Arians</i>, who had assisted at the
Council, to the Number of Eighty, returned a most submissive Answer,
and even thanked the Emperor for the great Pains he took to
establish the true Doctrine<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c015'><sup>[908]</sup></a>. However, <i>Taurus</i> declared that he could
by no means suffer them to depart till the rest had agreed with them,
and the whole Assembly was of one Mind. The orthodox Bishops
shewed at first some Resolution, and even refused to communicate
with their own Deputies. But this Resolution soon vanished; they
were eager to return to their Sees; the Emperor was inflexible; <i>Taurus</i>
took care to render the Place both inconvenient and disagreeable
to them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The greater Part<br/>yield.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Some therefore fell off, others followed their Example, the
rest began to waver, and, being so far got the better of, yielded soon
after, and went over to the <i>Arian</i> Party in such Crouds, that in a
very short time the Number of the orthodox Bishops, who continued
steady, was reduced to 20<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c015'><sup>[909]</sup></a>. At the Head of these was <i>Ph&oelig;badius</i>,
the celebrated Bishop of <i>Agen</i>, who seemed invincible; but nevertheless
was overcome in the End, not by the Menaces of the Emperor, or
his Prefect, but by the Craft and Subtilty of <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>,
who, finding they could by no other Means prevail upon him to accept
the <i>Sirmian</i> Confession, declared, that to put an End to the unhappy
Divisions that had so long rent the Church, they had at last resolved
to agree to such Alterations and Additions as should be judged
proper and necessary by him and his Collegues. This Declaration was
received by all with great Joy: <i>Ph&oelig;badius</i> triumphed, thinking he had
carried his Point, and saved the Reputation of the Council. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The others imposed<br/>upon by the</i> Arians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  To the Symbol
were immediately added several Anathemas against the <i>Arian</i> Heresy,
and an Article declaring <i>the Son equal to the Father, without Beginning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and before all Time</i>. When this Article was read, <i>Valens</i> desired,
that, in order to leave no room for new Disputes or Chicanery,
they would add, that <i>the Son was not a Creature like other Creatures</i><a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c015'><sup>[910]</sup></a>.
This was evidently supposing the Son to be a Creature only exalted
above all other Creatures; so that by admitting such an Article they
condemned the Doctrine which they designed to establish, and established
that which they designed to condemn. And yet of this neither
was <i>Ph&oelig;badius</i> aware, nor any of his Party, as they afterwards
solemnly declared<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c015'><sup>[911]</sup></a>. A most unaccountable Oversight, and hardly
credible! But <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c015'><sup>[912]</sup></a>, <i>Ambrose</i><a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c015'><sup>[913]</sup></a>, <i>Sulpitius Severus</i><a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c015'><sup>[914]</sup></a>, and <i>Fulgentius</i><a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c015'><sup>[915]</sup></a>,
took it upon their Word, and so must we. Neither Party
could brag of the Victory; for the <i>Arians</i> had anathematized the
Heresy of <i>Arius</i>; and on the other hand the orthodox Bishops had
deliberately agreed to the suppressing of the Words <i>Substance</i> and <i>Consubstantial</i>,
and inadvertently acknowleged the Son to be a Creature;
which was all the <i>Arians</i> aimed at, or could desire. The Council
being thus ended, new Deputies were sent to acquaint the Emperor
with what had passed, who being highly pleased with the Report made
by <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i> (for they were at the Head of the Deputation)
immediately granted the Bishops Leave to return to their respective
Sees, after they had been about Four Months at <i>Rimini</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Council no sooner broke up than the <i>Arians</i> began to proclaim
aloud the Victory they had gained, bragging, that it had not been defined
in the Council of <i>Rimini</i>, that the Son was not a Creature, but
only that he was not like other Creatures; and declaring it was, and
had always been their Opinion, that the Son was no more like the Father,
than a Piece of Glass was like an Emerald<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c015'><sup>[916]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They discover their<br/>Mistake.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Ph&oelig;badius</i>, and
the other Bishops who had adhered to him, were returned to their Sees
with great Joy, flattering themselves that they had sufficiently established
the Catholic Doctrine, and prevented all future Disputes: but,
finding that the <i>Arians</i> pretended their Tenets had been confirmed by
this very Council, and seriously reflecting on the Articles, which they
themselves had agreed to, they discovered at last how grosly they had
been imposed upon, and publicly retracted all they had said, done, or
signed, repugnant to the Truths of the Catholic Church<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c015'><sup>[917]</sup></a>. However,
<i>Gregory</i> Bishop of <i>Elvira</i> refused to communicate with any of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Bishops who had assisted at the Council of <i>Rimini</i>, and was on that
account commended by <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i><a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c015'><sup>[918]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Are judged Guilty by<br/>the exiled Bishops.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The exiled Bishops,
and those who lay concealed, agreed among themselves by Letters,
to declare them for ever incapable of performing any Episcopal or
Sacerdotal Functions, and to admit them to the Communion of the
Church only in the Capacity of Laymen<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c015'><sup>[919]</sup></a>. When Peace was restored
to the Church by the Death of <i>Constantius</i> in 361. most of the orthodox
Bishops were for deposing all those of the Council of <i>Rimini</i>, and
placing others in their room. But this Sentence the People would
not suffer to be put in Execution, rising every-where in Defence of
their Pastors, and in some Places insulting, beating, and even killing,
those who came to depose them<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c015'><sup>[920]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Great Disagreement<br/>in the Council of</i><br/>Seleucia.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Council of <i>Seleucia</i>, it met on the 27th of <i>September</i>
359. and consisted only of One hundred and Sixty Bishops, all <i>Arians</i>,
or <i>Semi-Arians</i>, except Twelve or Thirteen orthodox Bishops from
<i>Egypt</i><a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c015'><sup>[921]</sup></a>. This Assembly <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> calls the <i>Tower</i> of <i>Calane</i>,
or <i>Babel</i>, the Council of <i>Caiaphas</i><a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c015'><sup>[922]</sup></a>. And indeed with a great
deal of Reason; for nothing was there seen but Tumult, Confusion,
and Disorder. The <i>Anomeans</i> and <i>Semi-Arians</i> appeared so irreconcilably
incensed against each other, and carried on their Debates with
so much Animosity and Bitterness, that the Quæstor <i>Leonas</i>, whom
the Emperor had appointed to assist at the Council, thinking it impossible
they should ever agree in any one Point, rose up at their
Fourth Meeting, while they were in the Heat of the Dispute, and,
withdrawing abruptly, put an End to that Session, nay, and to the
Council; for, being invited the next Day, the First of <i>October</i>, to
the Assembly, he refused to go, saying, that he did not conceive his
Presence to be at all necessary, since they might quarrel and scold as
much as they pleased without him<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c015'><sup>[923]</sup></a>. This he did, says <i>Sozomen</i>, to
favour the <i>Anomeans</i>, who thence took Occasion to absent themselves
from the Council, which, as it was chiefly composed of <i>Semi-Arians</i>,
seemed determined to condemn their Doctrine<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c015'><sup>[924]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Semi-Arians<br/><i>condemn and depose<br/>the</i> Arians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, the <i>Semi-Arians</i>
met by themselves; and, finding they could by no means prevail
upon the <i>Anomeans</i> to return to the Council, they condemned
their Doctrine as heretical and blasphemous, excommunicated and deposed
the leading Men of their Party, appointed others in their room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and gave Notice thereof to their respective Churches<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c015'><sup>[925]</sup></a>. Before they
broke up, they dispatched Ten Deputies to acquaint the Emperor with
the Transactions of the Council. But the Bishops whom they had
deposed, arriving at Court before them, and being by their Friends
there immediately introduced to <i>Constantius</i>, they prejudiced him
against the Council of <i>Seleucia</i> to such a Degree, that it was some
time before he could prevail upon himself to hear the Deputies.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They sign the last<br/>Confession of</i> Sirmium.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, he heard them at last, and, by threatening them with Exile
if they did not comply, obliged them to sign the last Confession of
<i>Sirmium</i>, which had been rejected by the Council as <i>Arian</i><a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c015'><sup>[926]</sup></a>. In this
he spent the whole Day, and great Part of the Night, preceding the
First of <i>January</i>, though he was obliged to make the necessary Preparations
for entering on that Day his Tenth Consulate with the usual
Pomp and Solemnity<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c015'><sup>[927]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Arians,<i>in their<br/>Turn, condemn and<br/>depose the</i> Semi-Arians,<br/> <i>and also sign the last Confession of</i> Sirmium.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Beginning of the Year 360. the <i>Anomeans</i> assembling by
themselves at <i>Constantinople</i> as the <i>Semi-Arians</i> had done at <i>Seleucia</i>,
in order to ingratiate themselves with the Emperor, not only received
the last <i>Sirmian</i> Confession, but condemned all other Confessions or
Symbols that had been made till then, or should be made for the
future. They then declared all the Acts of the Council of <i>Seleucia</i>
void and null; and, to be even with the <i>Semi-Arians</i>, deposed, under
various Pretences, such of their Party as had most contributed to the
deposing of them, and even prevailed upon the Emperor to send them
into Exile<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c015'><sup>[928]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An Order from the<br/>Emperor injoining all<br/>Bishops to sign the</i><br/>Sirmian <i>Confession</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>They did not stop here, but obtained of <i>Constantius</i> an Order,
which was published throughout the Empire, commanding all Bishops
to sign the <i>Sirmian</i> Confession, on pain of forfeiting their Dignity,
and being sent into Exile<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c015'><sup>[929]</sup></a><a id='rN18' /><a href='#fN18' class='c015'><sup>[N18]</sup></a>. This Order was executed with the utmost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Rigour in all the Provinces of the Empire, and very few were
found, who did not sign with their Hands what they condemned
in their Hearts<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c015'><sup>[930]</sup></a>. Many, who till then had been thought invincible,
were overcome, and complied with the Times; and such as did not,
were driven, without Distinction, from their Sees, into Exile, and
others appointed in their room, the signing of that Confession being a
Qualification indispensably requisite both for obtaining and keeping
the Episcopal Dignity<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c015'><sup>[931]</sup></a>. Thus were all the Sees throughout the Empire
filled with <i>Arians</i>, insomuch that in the whole East not one orthodox
Bishop was left, and in the West but one, <i>viz.</i> <i>Gregory</i> Bishop
of <i>Elvira</i> in <i>Andalusia</i>, and he, in all Likelihood, obliged to absent
himself from his Flock, and lie concealed, as were probably Pope <i>Liberius</i>,
and <i>Vincentius</i> of <i>Capua</i>, if what <i>Theodoret</i> relates of them
be true, <i>viz.</i> that they never consented to the Decrees of <i>Rimini</i><a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c015'><sup>[932]</sup></a>,
and thereby retrieved the Reputation they had lost, the former by
signing the <i>Sirmian</i> Confession of the Year 357. and the other by
communicating with the <i>Arians</i> in 353. as I have related above. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>It was probably<br/>signed by</i> Liberius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But
what <i>Theodoret</i> writes may be justly called in question; for it is not
at all probable, that the Emperor, and the <i>Arian</i> Party, so warmly bent
on establishing that Confession throughout the Empire, would have
suffered the Bishop of the Imperial City, of the first See, to reject it,
without deposing him, as they had done the Bishops of all the other
great Sees, and appointing another more compliant in his room.
This could not be prevented by his concealing himself in the Caverns
and C&oelig;meteries about <i>Rome</i>, as he is said to have done in his Acts
quoted by <i>Baronius</i><a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c015'><sup>[933]</sup></a>, though he might by that means have escaped
being sent into Exile. Besides, had he, instead of complying with
the Emperor’s express Command, withdrawn and absconded, I cannot
think that his Antagonist <i>Felix</i>, who was still alive, and had done
nothing we know of to disoblige the Emperor, and the <i>Arian</i> Party,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>by whom he had been formerly raised to that See, would have neglected
so favourable an Opportunity of recovering his antient Dignity.
If what <i>Theodoret</i> says be true, <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> is highly
to blame for not excepting <i>Liberius</i>; when he writ, that the Bishops
either all complied, or were driven into Exile, excepting a few,
who were too insignificant to be taken notice of by the Emperor, or
his Ministers<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c015'><sup>[934]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Arianism <i>universally<br/>obtains</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Be that as it will, it is certain, that at this time the
<i>Arian</i> Doctrine universally obtained; that the Face of the Church appeared
quite deformed and disfigured<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c015'><sup>[935]</sup></a>, that the whole World saw
itself, with Astonishment, all on a sudden become <i>Arian</i><a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c015'><sup>[936]</sup></a>; that the
Boat of St. <i>Peter</i>, to use St. <i>Jerom</i>’s Expression, tossed by furious

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN18'>N18</a>. This Confession is called sometimes
the <i>Confession of</i> Nice <i>in</i> Thrace, and sometimes
the <i>Confession of</i> Rimini; but it differed
from both. By the Confession of
<i>Nice</i>, the Son was acknowleged to be like
to the Father, without the Addition of the
Words <i>in all Things</i>, which were an essential
Part of the last Confession of <i>Sirmium</i>.
In that of <i>Rimini</i> the Son was said <i>not to be
a Creature like other Creatures</i>, and there
were no such Words in the Confession of
<i>Sirmium</i>. But by all Three the Word
<i>Consubstantial</i> was rejected, and no other
would satisfy the Orthodox, acknowleging
the Son to be <i>of the same Substance with
the Father</i>. Both the <i>Arians</i> and <i>Semi-Arians</i>
allowed the Son to be like to the Father:
but that Likeness was by them very
differently understood and interpreted. The
<i>Arians</i> held him to be <i>like</i> rather by Grace
than by Nature, and as like as a Creature
could be to the Creator<a id='rN18.1' /><a href='#fN18.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The <i>Semi-Arians</i>
confessed him to be like in <i>Nature</i>,
in <i>Existence</i>, in <i>Essence</i>, in <i>Substance</i>, and
in <i>every thing else</i>. But the Orthodox
maintained him to be of the <i>same Substance</i>
with the Father, and consequently of the
<i>same Existence</i>, <i>Essence</i>, &amp;c. and, to express
this <i>Sameness</i> or <i>Identity</i>, they chose
the Word <i>Consubstantial</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following Year 361. the <i>Anomeans</i>, not fully satisfied with the
Confession of Faith, which, at their Suggestion, the Emperor had
taken so much Pains to establish throughout the Empire, assembled,
with his Leave, at <i>Antioch</i>, and there drew up a new Symbol, or
Creed, wherein it was expresly said, that <i>the Son was in every thing
unlike to the Father</i>, and that <i>He was made out of nothing</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constantius <i>designs<br/>to establish the<br/>Doctrine of the</i> Pure<br/>Arians;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Constantius</i>
had formerly expressed the greatest Abhorrence to this
Doctrine, and had even banished those who held, and refused to anathematize,
such <i>impious Blasphemies</i>, as he then styled them<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c015'><sup>[938]</sup></a>. But,
having lately changed his Opinion, which was chiefly owing to the
great Influence the Eunuch <i>Eusebius</i> had over him, he was now no
less sanguine for the <i>Unlikeness</i> of the Son to the Father, than he
had been hitherto for the <i>Likeness</i><a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c015'><sup>[939]</sup></a>. In order therefore to abolish
the antient, and establish this new Creed in its room, he appointed a
Council to meet at <i>Nice</i> in <i>Bithynia</i><a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c015'><sup>[940]</sup></a>, which, without all Doubt,
he would have treated in the same manner as he had done that of
<i>Rimini</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but is prevented by<br/>Death</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But, as the Bishops were preparing to set out for the appointed
Place, they were stopped by the sudden and unexpected News
of the Emperor’s Death, which put an End to all his Councils, and
was heard with equal Joy by those of the <i>Orthodox</i> and <i>Semi-Arian</i>
Party. He was succeeded by <i>Julian</i>, surnamed the <i>Apostate</i>, who immediately
recalled all those who had been banished by <i>Constantius</i>
on account of their Religion<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c015'><sup>[941]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The exiled Bishops<br/>recalled by</i> Julian.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Whatever was his Motive, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Church reaped great Advantages from the Return of so many eminent
Prelates, who, in the worst of Times, had, with an invincible
Firmness and Constancy, stood up in her Defence. Among the rest
returned, on this Occasion, the famous <i>Meletius</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>,
<i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i>, <i>Lucifer</i> of <i>Cagliari</i>, who had been all Three
confined to the most distant Parts of <i>Thebais</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
<i>Pelagius</i> of <i>Laodicea</i> in <i>Ph&oelig;nicia</i>, and, to the inexpressible
Joy of the Orthodox Party, their great Champion <i>Athanasius</i> Bishop
of <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c015'><sup>[942]</sup></a>, who immediately resumed, undisturbed, his Episcopal
Function; <i>George</i>, the Usurper of his See, having been assassinated
a little while before by the Pagans of <i>Alexandria</i>, on account
of his Avarice and Cruelty<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c015'><sup>[943]</sup></a>. In other Places the Orthodox Bishops,
finding the <i>Arians</i> in Possession of their Sees, contented themselves
with being acknowleged by those of their Communion, without
attempting to drive out their Antagonists, which would have
created great Confusion, and endless Disturbances in the Church. <i>Julian</i>
refused to interpose his Authority in favour of either Party, saying,
that as he was not so well acquainted with the Nature of their
Disputes as a just and impartial Judge ought to be, he hoped they
would excuse him, lest he should be guilty of some Injustice, and
settle Matters of such Importance among themselves. <i>Athanasius</i>
entered <i>Alexandria</i> in a kind of Triumph, which is described in a

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i><br/>Alexandria.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i> being thus reinstated, and again at full
Liberty to exert his Zeal for the Catholic Cause, his first Care was
to retrieve his fallen Brethren, and reunite them to the Church. With
this View he assembled, in 362. a Council at <i>Alexandria</i>, composed
only of Confessors, that is, of such Bishops as had chosen rather to
forfeit their Dignities and Sees, than receive or sign the <i>Arian</i> Confession
of <i>Rimini</i> or <i>Sirmium</i>. This was one of the most respectable
Councils that was ever held in the Church, not so much in regard
of the Numbers (for I find not above Twenty named) as of the Merit,
Virtue, and Sanctity of the Members that composed it. The
chief Subject of their Debates, or rather Inquiries, was to find out the
most proper Means of restoring Tranquillity to the Church, after so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>dreadful a Storm. Some, and among the rest <i>Lucifer</i> Bishop of
<i>Cagliari</i>, who did not assist in Person, but by his Deputies, the
Two Deacons <i>Herennius</i> and <i>Agapetus</i>, were for deposing all those
who had signed the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>, and cutting them off from
the Communion of the Church. But this unseasonable Severity was
condemned by the far greater Part, as tending to raise a new Storm,
and involve the Church in greater Troubles than ever, which the Emperor
<i>Julian</i> would take care to improve, to the total Ruin of the
Christian Religion. <i>Athanasius</i> therefore was for using Severity only
with the Authors, and chief Promoters, of the late general Defection:
and his Opinion prevailed; for a Decree was enacted, importing, that
the Authors of the late general Prevarication should, even upon their
Repentance, be received to the Communion of the Church only in
the Capacity of Laymen, but that the rest should be all kept in, or
restored to, their Sees, upon their publicly renouncing the <i>Arian</i>
Communion, and embracing the Faith of <i>Nice</i><a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c015'><sup>[945]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A Schism formed by</i><br/>Lucifer, <i>Bishop of</i><br/>Cagliari.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Decree was
every-where received with the greatest Joy, the Bishop of <i>Cagliari</i> being
the only Man, either in the East or West, who opposed it, and
that with so much Obstinacy, that, rather than yield, he chose to separate
himself from the Communion of the rest, and to form a new
Schism, which bore his Name, and soon gained a considerable Footing,
especially in the West; several Persons no less distinguished for
Piety than Learning, and among the rest <i>Gregory</i>, the famous Bishop
of <i>Elvira</i>, having adopted the Sentiments of a Man, who had
suffered so much for the Purity of the Faith. As <i>Lucifer</i> is honoured
by the Church of <i>Rome</i> as a Saint, and his Festival is kept on the 20th
of <i>May</i><a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c015'><sup>[946]</sup></a>, <i>Baronius</i> pretends, that he abandoned his Schism, and returned
to the Communion of the Church, before his Death<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c015'><sup>[947]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He never returned<br/>to the Communion of<br/>the Church.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But
his Contemporary <i>Ruffinus</i>, who probably knew him, assures us, that
he died in the Schism, which he had formed<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c015'><sup>[948]</sup></a>. <i>Jerom</i> often speaks
of his Schism, but no-where gives us the least Hint of his having
ever quitted it; which would have afforded him a strong Argument
against the <i>Luciferians</i>, and he would not have failed to urge it, in
the Book which he wrote to convince them of their Error. That
Writer speaks of <i>Lucifer</i>, on all Occasions, with the greatest Respect,
even in the Book which he writ against his Followers: he owns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>that his Intention was pure and upright; that it was not Pride, Thirst
after Glory, or a Desire of transmitting his Name to Posterity, but a
mistaken Zeal, that led him astray, and made him disapprove what
the others approved; he even distinguishes him with the Title of the
<i>Blessed Lucifer</i><a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c015'><sup>[949]</sup></a>. And hence <i>Baronius</i> concludes, that he returned
to the Communion of the Church; for otherwise, says the Annalist<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c015'><sup>[950]</sup></a>,
St. <i>Jerom</i> had never given him the Title of <i>Blessed</i>, or <i>Saint</i>. But
that he did not return, is manifest, from the Silence of St. <i>Jerom</i> on
that Head, and from the Authority of a contemporary Writer quoted
above: and hence I may draw a Conclusion far better grounded than
that of <i>Baronius</i>; <i>viz.</i> that St. <i>Jerom</i> excused him on account of
his good Intention; and, consequently, that he did not hold the uncharitable
Doctrine of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, excluding from Salvation
all who die out of her Communion, let their Intention be never so
good. It is to be observed, that the <i>Luciferians</i> not only excluded
from their Communion those who had received the <i>Arian</i> Confession,
but all who communicated with them, even after they had anathematized
that Confession, and publicly embraced the Faith of
<i>Nice</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i><br/>Alexandria <i>saves the<br/>Church from Ruin</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Resolution taken by the Confessors in the Council of <i>Alexandria</i>,
is said to have saved the Church from utter Ruin. For had
that prevailed, which was urged with so much Warmth by <i>Lucifer</i>,
the Bishops, who had chosen rather to sign the <i>Arian</i> Confession than
forfeit their Sees, would have kept them in Defiance of a Decree
made by a small Number of their Collegues, and in all Likelihood
excommunicated and deposed, in their Turn, those who had excommunicated
and deposed them: and, in that Case, the <i>Arian</i> Party,
comprehending almost all the Bishops of the Church, must have prevailed.
But as nothing was required of them, to keep their Sees, besides
their renouncing the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>, which they had embraced,
and embracing that of <i>Nice</i>, which they had renounced, they
readily complied with the Decree of the Council; insomuch that the
following Year 363. <i>Athanasius</i>, in a Letter, which he wrote to the
Emperor <i>Jovian</i>, immediately after the Death of <i>Julian</i>, could assure
that Prince, that the Faith of <i>Nice</i> had been received, and was
professed, in all the Provinces of the Empire, which he enumerates;
but omits those of <i>Thrace</i>, <i>Bithynia</i>, and the <i>Hellespont</i><a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c015'><sup>[951]</sup></a>, the Bishops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>there still continuing obstinately to maintain the Doctrine of
<i>Arius</i>, and to reject the Faith of <i>Nice</i>, as we learn from <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c015'><sup>[952]</sup></a>,
<i>Socrates</i><a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c015'><sup>[953]</sup></a>, and <i>Basil</i><a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c015'><sup>[954]</sup></a>; nay, at <i>Constantinople</i>, the Orthodox had
but a small Chapel to assemble in, all the Churches being in Possession
of the <i>Arians</i>, under <i>Eudoxius</i>, a leading Man among the
<i>Pure Arians</i>, who had usurped that See<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c015'><sup>[955]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Faith of</i> Nice<br/><i>everywhere<br/>established</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For the better establishing
of the Orthodox Faith, after the violent Shock it had lately received,
Councils were held in several Provinces of the Empire<a id='rN19' /><a href='#fN19' class='c015'><sup>[N19]</sup></a>, and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>all was received the Faith of <i>Nice</i>, the Confession of <i>Rimini</i> condemned,
and the Words <i>Substance</i> and <i>Consubstantial</i> re-established<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c015'><sup>[956]</sup></a>.
A very strong Proof, that the Assent given before to the <i>Arian</i> Doctrines
had been solely the Effect of Force, or of Interest, which being
now removed, and all left at Liberty to act as their Consciences
only directed, the Orthodox Faith prevailed as much as the other had
done under <i>Constantius</i>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<div class='footnote' id='fN19'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN19'>N19</a>. The Bishops of <i>Gaul</i> assembled at
<i>Paris</i> in 362. and, having first owned
their Crime, in approving and signing
the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>, they acknowleged
the Three Persons of the Trinity to be
of the same Nature and Substance, and condemned
<i>Ursacius</i>, <i>Valens</i>, and <i>Auxentius</i>
the <i>Arian</i> Bishop of <i>Milan</i>. This Council
was convened by St. <i>Hilarius</i>, Bishop of
<i>Poitiers</i>; and a Letter, which the Council
writ on this Occasion, has been transmitted
to us, among the Fragments of his
Works. He is said to have assembled several
other Councils in <i>Gaul</i>, for the re-establishing
of the Faith of <i>Nice</i>, which is
all we know of them. The same Year
362. the Bishops of <i>Italy</i> assembling, declared
void and null the Acts of the Council
of <i>Rimini</i>, embraced the Faith of <i>Nice</i>,
and, with one Accord, anathematized <i>Ursacius</i>
and <i>Valens</i>, as the leading Men of the
<i>Arian</i> Party. There is, among the Fragments
of St. <i>Hilarius</i>, a Letter on this Subject,
from the <i>Italian</i> to the <i>Illyrian</i> Bishops.
Where this Council was held I find
no-where recorded. In the Year 363. the
Emperor <i>Jovian</i> desiring to be instructed in
the Faith of the Catholic Church, by <i>Athanasius</i>
and the <i>Egyptian</i> Bishops, who were
come to wait on him, they assembled in
Council, and agreed to propose no other
Creed to him but that of <i>Nice</i>. At the
same time they condemned the Heresy of
<i>Macedonius</i>, denying the Divinity of the
Holy Ghost. This Council is generally
thought to have been held at <i>Alexandria</i>.
But, from the Letter, which they presented
to the Emperor, it appears to have consisted
of some <i>Egyptian</i> Bishops, who, as it
is there said, were appointed to represent
all the others of the same Province<a id='rN19.1' /><a href='#fN19.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
Had the Council been held at <i>Alexandria</i>,
they had, I should think, been all present. It
must therefore have assembled in some Place
out of <i>Egypt</i>; and where more likely than
at <i>Antioch</i>? For there the Emperor was this
very Year, and there <i>Athanasius</i> waited on
him. The same Year another Council was
held at <i>Antioch</i>, under <i>Melecius</i> Bishop of
that City. In that Council <i>Acacius</i>, Bishop
of <i>Cæsarea</i> in <i>Pælestine</i>, who had been at
the Head of the <i>Arian</i> Party, in the Latter-end
of the Reign of <i>Constantius</i>, and his
Followers, commonly styled <i>Acacians</i>, embraced
the Faith of <i>Nice</i>, and admitted the
Term <i>Consubstantial</i>. <i>Acacius</i> had no other
Faith but that of the Party which prevailed.
Hence, in the Time of <i>Jovian</i>, who favoured
the Orthodox Party, he professed
the Faith of <i>Nice</i>; but Two Years after he
had signed it, he joined the <i>Arians</i> anew,
seeing them in great Favour with the Emperor
<i>Valens</i>. Several other Councils were
held, from the Year 363. to 368. of which
we have no particular Account. For <i>Athanasius</i>
tells us, in general Terms, that many
Councils assembled in <i>France</i>, in <i>Spain</i>, at
<i>Rome</i>, in <i>Dalmatia</i>, in <i>Dardania</i>, in <i>Macedonia</i>,
in <i>Epirus</i>, in <i>Greece</i>, in <i>Candia</i>,
and the other Islands, in <i>Sicily</i>, in <i>Cyprus</i>,
in <i>Lycia</i>, in <i>Isauria</i>, in <i>Egypt</i>, and in <i>Arabia</i>;
and that they all met to maintain the
Orthodox Faith, the Faith of the Council
of <i>Nice</i><a id='rN19.2' /><a href='#fN19.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. In his Letter to the Emperor
<i>Jovian</i> he assures him, that the Symbol of
<i>Nice</i> was received in the above-mentioned
Provinces, and besides, in <i>Britain</i>, in
<i>Africa</i>, in <i>Pamphylia</i>, in <i>Libya</i>, in <i>Pontus</i>,
in <i>Cappadocia</i>, and in the East, that is, in
the Patriarchate of <i>Antioch</i><a id='rN19.3' /><a href='#fN19.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. But in the
Provinces of <i>Thrace</i>, of <i>Bithynia</i>, and the
<i>Hellespont</i>, the <i>Semi-Arians</i> prevailed, till
they were overpowered by the <i>Arians</i>,
strongly supported by the Emperor <i>Valens</i>,
a most zealous Defender of <i>Arianism</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Council convened<br/>by the</i> Semi-Arians.</div>

<p class='c001'>As every one was allowed by <i>Julian</i> to believe what he
pleased, and to own his Belief, whatever it was, the <i>Semi-Arians</i>
convened a Council, soon after the Death of <i>Constantius</i>,
who, in the Latter-end of his Life, had begun to persecute them as
much as he had favoured them before. This Council was composed
of those chiefly who had assisted at that of <i>Seleucia</i>, of which I have
spoken above; and they all agreed to condemn and anathematize the
Doctrine of the <i>Pure Arians</i>, with the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>, and to
sign anew the Confession of <i>Antioch</i>, establishing a Likeness in Substance
between the Son and the Father. Thus they pretended to keep
a due Mean between the Two opposite Extremes, of the Western
Bishops, whose <i>Consubstantiality</i>, they said, left no room for the Distinction
of Persons; and of the <i>Pure Arians</i>, who denied all Likeness<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c015'><sup>[957]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Sect of the</i><br/>Macedonians.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It was after this Council that the <i>Semi-Arians</i>, separating
themselves from the Communion of the <i>Pure Arians</i>, began to form
a distinct Sect, and to be called <i>Macedonians</i>; which Name was given
them from <i>Macedonius</i>, late Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, but deposed by
the <i>Pure Arians</i>, in the Council they held in that City in 360. to
make room for their great Champion <i>Eudoxius</i>, translated formerly
from <i>Germanicia</i> to <i>Antioch</i>, and now from <i>Antioch</i> to <i>Constantinople</i>.
They were also named <i>Marathonians</i>, from <i>Marathonius</i>, Bishop
of <i>Nicomedia</i>, who, together with <i>Macedonius</i>, was at the Head
of the Party; and <i>Pneumatomachi</i>, that is, Enemies to the Holy
Ghost, whose Divinity they denied, which was their chief, if not
their only Error; for some are of Opinion, that tho’ they rejected
the Word <i>Consubstantial</i>, yet they agreed with the Orthodox in the
Meaning of it. They led very regular, austere, and edifying Lives;
and are, on that Score, highly commended and extolled by <i><a id='corr172.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Greg ry'>Gregory</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_172.35'><ins class='correction' title='Greg ry'>Gregory</ins></a></span>
Nazianzen</i><a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c015'><sup>[958]</sup></a>. No Wonder therefore, that they soon spread all over
the East, and gained every-where great Numbers of Followers. At
<i>Constantinople</i>, and in the neighbouring Cities and Provinces, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>were followed not only by the greater Part of the People, but by
some Persons of Distinction, by such as were most remarkable for
their Piety, by intire Monasteries, both of Men and Women<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c015'><sup>[959]</sup></a>. The
Inhabitants of <i>Cyzicus</i> in the <i>Propontis</i> were almost all of this Sect,
and we are told of some Miracles wrought by a <i>Macedonian</i> of that
Place<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c015'><sup>[960]</sup></a>, which <i>Baronius</i> will not allow, though as well attested as any
he relates.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>They are persecuted<br/>by the Emperor</i><br/>Valens.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor <i>Valens</i>, who reigned in the East, which had
been yielded to him by his Brother <i>Valentinian</i>, when he took
him for his Collegue in the Empire, spared no Pains to reconcile this
Sect with that of the <i>Arians</i>, which he greatly favoured. But, finding
them no less averse to the <i>Arians</i> than the Orthodox themselves,
he began in the Year 366. to persecute them with great Cruelty. To
avoid this Persecution they resolved to recur to the Emperor <i>Valentinian</i>,
and, embracing the Faith professed by him and the Western
Bishops, to put themselves under his Protection. Accordingly they
dispatched Three of their Body, <i>viz.</i> <i>Eustathius</i> Bishop of <i>Sebaste</i>,
<i>Sylvanus</i> of <i>Tarsus</i>, and <i>Theophilus</i> of <i>Castabala</i>, to acquaint the
Emperor, in the Name of the rest, with the Resolution they had
taken, and implore his Protection<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c015'><sup>[961]</sup></a>. These, being informed, on their
Arrival in <i>Italy</i>, that <i>Valentinian</i> was waging War with the Barbarians
on the Borders of <i>Gaul</i>, instead of repairing to him, which they
apprehended might be attended with no small Danger, went strait
to <i>Rome</i>, and there delivered to <i>Liberius</i> Letters from their Brethren,
directed to him, and to the other Bishops of the West, whom
they earnestly intreated to use their Interest with the Emperor, in
their Behalf, assuring them, that they sincerely renounced the Errors
they had hitherto held, and embraced the Catholic Faith, as explained
and defined by the Council of <i>Nice</i><a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c015'><sup>[962]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Deliver to</i> Liberius<br/><i>their Confession of<br/>Faith</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Liberius</i>, notwithstanding
these Assurances, suspected their Sincerity; and therefore could not,
by any means, be prevailed upon to communicate with them, or even
to hear them, till they had delivered to him a Confession of Faith,
under their Hand, and in the Name of the whole Party, wherein
they anathematized those of <i>Rimini</i>, and <i>Nice</i> in <i>Bithynia</i>; condemned
the Heresy of <i>Arius</i>, with all other Heresies; and received
the Definitions of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, those particularly that related
to <i>Consubstantiality</i>. To this Confession they added a solemn
Protestation, declaring themselves ready to submit to the Sentence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>such Judges as the Pope should think fit to appoint, should they, or
those by whom they had been sent, be ever for the future accused or
suspected of swerving in the least from the Faith they now embraced
and professed<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c015'><sup>[963]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who admits them to<br/>his Communion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In virtue of this Confession, whereof the Original
was carefully lodged in the Archives of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Liberius</i>
admitted the Deputies to his Communion; and, upon their Departure,
writ, in the Name of all the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, and the
West, to the <i>Macedonian</i> Bishops, of whom he names 59, signifying
the great Joy, which their Letters, and the Confession of Faith,
signed by their Deputies, had occasioned at <i>Rome</i>, and in all the
Western Churches, since by such a Confession they were all again
happily united in one Faith. In this Letter <i>Liberius</i> assures them,
that all the Bishops, who had assisted at the Council of <i>Rimini</i>, had
retracted the Doctrine, which they had been forced to sign there;
and were more than ever incensed against the <i>Arians</i>, on account
of the Violence, which, at their Instigation, had been offered them<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c015'><sup>[964]</sup></a>.
The <i>Macedonians</i> admitted the Divinity of the Son, but denied that
of the Holy Ghost; nay, this was their favourite Doctrine, and, as it
were, the Characteristic of their Sect; but <i>Liberius</i>, and the other
Western Bishops, not suspecting them of such an Error, which in all
Likelihood they had not yet publicly owned, admitted them to their
Communion, without examining them on that Head.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Liberius <i>dies</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Liberius</i> died soon after, that is, on the 23d or 24th of <i>September</i>, of
the present Year 366. as we are told by <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>, whose
Authority is preferable to that of any other, since, at this very time,
they lived at <i>Rome</i><a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c015'><sup>[965]</sup></a>. He had been chosen on the 22d of <i>May</i> 352.
so that he governed the Church of <i>Rome</i> Fourteen Years, Four Months,
and a Day or Two. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The deplorable<br/>Condition of the<br/>Church in his Time.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Liberius</i> lived in troublesome Times, the worst
the Church had ever yet seen. She had Two dangerous Enemies to
contend with at the same time, the Power of the Prince then on
the Imperial Throne, and the Craft of a most subtle and deceitful
Party. The Prince employed all his Power to overcome, with Oppression,
those whom the Party could not over-reach with their Craft;
and the Party to over-reach with their Craft such as the Prince could
not overcome with Oppression. On the other hand, the Prelates,
even some who were reputed the Pillars of the Church, seemed to
have lost that Zeal, Firmness, and Intrepidity, which they had so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>gloriously exerted under the Pagan Princes, and few were found
among them, whose Virtue was proof against the Loss of their Dignity,
or Exile. Hence the Defection became general, and the Orthodox
Party was brought so low, that it must have been utterly quashed,
had <i>Constantius</i> lived a few Years longer. But Providence interposed;
<i>Constantius</i> died while he was pursuing his Scheme with the greatest
Success; and <i>Julian</i>, his Successor, by betraying an equal Hatred and
Aversion to Christians of all Denominations, obliged them to forget
their Quarrels among themselves, to lay aside their Animosity against
each other, and to unite in their mutual Defence against him, as a
common Enemy. <i>Jovian</i>, who succeeded him, proved no less favourable
to the Orthodox, than <i>Constantius</i> had been to the <i>Arians</i>.
Many therefore of the latter, and among the rest <i>Acacius</i>, who was
at the Head of the <i>Pure Arians</i>, to gain the Favour of the Emperor,
publicly renounced the Doctrine of <i>Arius</i>, and embraced that of <i>Nice</i>.
<i>Jovian</i>, after a short Reign of Seven Months and Twenty Days, was
succeeded by <i>Valentinian</i>, who continued to countenance the Orthodox,
as his Predecessor had done, though he did not use the <i>Arians</i>
with that Rigour which some Zealots expected from a Confessor,
which Title he had deserved under <i>Julian</i>. However, as he professed
the Orthodox Faith, that Party universally prevailed; insomuch
that, in a very short time, no Traces of <i>Arianism</i> were left in the
West, except at <i>Milan</i>, under the <i>Arian</i> Bishop <i>Auxentius</i>, and in a
few Cities of <i>Illyricum</i>, where it was kept up by <i>Ursacius</i>, <i>Valens</i>,
<i>Germinius</i>, and their Disciples, till the following Century, when it
was every-where re-established there by the <i>Goths</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>By whom</i> Arianism<br/><i>was banished out of<br/>the West</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i> ascribes to <i>Liberius</i> the banishing of <i>Arianism</i> out of the
West, and the establishing of the Orthodox Faith in its room; but that
Glory was owing, according to <i>Ruffinus</i>, to <i>Hilarius</i> of <i>Poitiers</i>, and
<i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i>, who, like the Two great Luminaries of the Universe,
to use his Words, enlightened with their Rays <i>Illyricum</i>, <i>Gaul</i>,
and <i>Italy</i>, dispelling every-where the Darkness of Heresy<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c015'><sup>[966]</sup></a>. He minutely

and Obstructions they met with in so pious and commendable an
Undertaking<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c015'><sup>[967]</sup></a>. But, as for <i>Liberius</i>, he does not so much as mention
him. And truly, from the Year 357. in which he fell, to his admitting
the <i>Macedonians</i> to his Communion in 366. which was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>last of his Life, the only thing I find recorded of him in the Antients,
is his writing a Letter to the Catholic Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, wherein he
exhorts them to atone for their past Conduct by renouncing the Errors
of the <i>Arians</i>, and receiving anew the Symbol of <i>Nice</i>. He adds,
that as this is the only Atonement, which it has been thought proper
to require of them, they ought to exert their Zeal against the Authors
of the Fault they committed, in proportion to the Grief they must feel
for committing it<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c015'><sup>[968]</sup></a>. This Letter has been transmitted to us among
the Fragments of <i>Hilarius</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Neither</i> Vincentius <i>of</i><br/>Capua, <i>nor</i> Liberius,<br/><i>assisted at the<br/>Council of</i> Rimini.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It is hard to guess what could induce

assisted at the Council of <i>Rimini</i> with the Character of the Pope’s Legate<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c015'><sup>[969]</sup></a>.
In what antient Author did he find the least Intimation or
distant Hint of such a Legation? <i>Vincentius</i> of <i>Capua</i>, though a
Person of great Eminency, is not even mentioned by any of the contemporary
Writers, who relate the Transactions of that Council, and
name the chief Prelates who composed it. 'Tis true we read of him,
in one Author, that he never consented to the Confession of <i>Rimini</i><a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c015'><sup>[970]</sup></a>:
but that is said of <i>Liberius</i> too<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c015'><sup>[971]</sup></a>, whom <i>Baronius</i> owns not to have

<div class='sidenote'>Liberius <i>is honoured<br/>as a Saint</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Liberius</i>, notwithstanding his Fall, is honoured both by the <i>Latin</i>
and <i>Greek</i> Churches as a Saint. By the former his Festival is kept on
the 23d of <i>September</i>, and by the latter on the 27th of <i>August</i><a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c015'><sup>[972]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Founding of the<br/>Church of</i> St. Mary<br/>the Greater.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He
erected a Church on the <i>Esquiline</i> Mount at <i>Rome</i>, which bore his
Name, and was called the <i>Basilic</i> of Liberius, till it was consecrated
to the Virgin <i>Mary</i> by <i>Sixtus</i> III. when it took the Name of <i>Sancta
Maria Major</i>, or <i>Saint Mary the Greater</i>. It owes its Foundation,
as is universally believed in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, to the following
Miracle. A <i>Roman</i> of the Patrician Order, and of Wealth equal
to his Rank, named <i>John</i>, having no Children, resolved to make a
free Gift of his whole Estate to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>. This Resolution he
imparted to his Wife, who consenting to it with great Alacrity, the
Estate was immediately made over to the holy Virgin, whom they
thenceforth jointly intreated, in their daily Prayers, to let them know
by some Token in what Manner she chose to dispose of it. Their
Prayers were heard, and, on the Night preceding the 5th of <i>August</i>,
when the Heat is most violent at <i>Rome</i>, a miraculous Snow fell from
Heaven, which covered Part of the <i>Esquiline</i> Mount. The same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Night the Patrician and his Wife were admonished in a Dream to
build a Church on the Spot of Ground which they should find covered
with Snow. Early next Morning they went to acquaint Pope <i>Liberius</i>
with what had happened, whom they found to have had the same
Dream; so that no room being now left to doubt of the Revelation,
the Pope appointed a grand Procession of the whole Clergy, in which
he walked himself, attended by Crouds of People, to the above-mentioned
Mount; and there, having caused the Snow, which still lay
unmelted, to be removed, on the Spot, which it had covered, he
laid the Foundation of that magnificent Basilic, which was reared at
the Expence of the Patrician, and is now known by the Name of
<i>Saint Mary the Greater</i>, and <i>Saint Mary in the Snow</i><a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c015'><sup>[973]</sup></a>. I should
not have thought such an idle Tale worthy of a Place in a grave History,
were it not recorded in the most authentic Book the Church of <i>Rome</i>
has after the Scripture, the <i>Roman Breviary</i>, a Book approved and
commended by the Council of <i>Trent</i>, and by the special Bulls of
Three Popes, <i>Pius</i> V. <i>Clement</i> VIII. and <i>Urban</i> VIII. of whom the
latter declares every thing it contains to be extracted from antient and
approved Authors, and to be agreeable to Truth<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c015'><sup>[974]</sup></a>. So that it would
be less dangerous, at least in <i>Italy</i>, to deny any Truth revealed in the
Scripture, than to question any Fable related in the <i>Breviary</i>. The
Feast of <i>the Snow</i>, or <i>St. Mary in the Snow</i>, is kept annually at
<i>Rome</i>, on the 5th of <i>August</i>, with the greatest Solemnity. The College
of Cardinals assists that Day at Divine Service in the Church of
<i>Saint Mary the Greater</i>; and the Pope, if not indisposed, or otherwise
prevented, officiates in Person: the <i>Primicerio</i>, or Dean of that
Church, reads the Account, which I have delivered above; and, that
nothing may be wanting to complete the Farce, Numbers of Children
are employed, during the Service, to drop Jessamins from the Gallery
on the Congregation, in Remembrance and Imitation of the miraculous
Snow. And truly by Children alone such Fables are proper to
be acted and believed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Writings of</i><br/>Liberius.</div>

<p class='c001'>Several Pieces have reached our Times, which were either written
by, or have been falsly ascribed to, <i>Liberius</i>. Among the former are,
his Letter in Answer to the <i>Macedonian</i> Bishops; another to the Catholic
Bishops of <i>Italy</i>; which have been both mentioned above;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and a Discourse, which he pronounced on <i>Christmas-day</i> in the Church
of St. <i>Peter</i>, on Occasion of his giving the sacred Veil to <i>Marcellina</i>
the Sister of St. <i>Ambrose</i> when she embraced the State of Virginity.
This Discourse St. <i>Ambrose</i> has inserted in his Third Book on Virgins,
but in his own Style, which is very different from that of <i>Liberius</i>,
who had not the Gift of Eloquence<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c015'><sup>[975]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Writings falsly<br/>ascribed to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Among the Pieces falsly ascribed
to <i>Liberius</i>, most Men of Learning reckon the Confession of
Faith, written in <i>Greek</i>, which he is supposed to have sent to <i>Athanasius</i>.
This Piece <i>Baronius</i> will, by all means, have to be genuine;
and the Use he makes of it is somewhat extraordinary. The Council
of <i>Alexandria</i>, to which the Church owed her Safety, was convened
by <i>Athanasius</i>, upon his Return from Exile, as I have related above.
By that small Assembly, consisting only of Confessors, was enacted
the famous Decree with respect to those, who had communicated with
the <i>Arians</i>, and signed the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>. To that Decree
the whole Church readily conformed; so that the Honour of saving
the Church was chiefly owing to <i>Athanasius</i>, and wholly to him and
the other Confessors. Of <i>Liberius</i> not the least Mention is made; so
that he had no Share in that Glory. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Strange Conjectures<br/>of</i> Baronius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The <i>Annalist</i> therefore, not
being able to bring in his Sovereign Pontiff upon the Authority of any
Records now extant, has recourse to those that probably never were;
or, if they ever were, are now no more. He supposes Part of the
above-mentioned Confession of Faith, sent by <i>Liberius</i> to <i>Athanasius</i>,
to be wanting; and <i>Liberius</i>, in the Part that is wanting, to have
impowered <i>Athanasius</i> to convene a Council, and to have appointed
<i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i>, and <i>Lucifer</i> of <i>Cagliari</i>, to assist at that Council
with the Character of his Legates. Such wild and extravagant
Suppositions require a very strong Proof to support them, some plausible
Conjectures at least to give them an Appearance of Truth. But
that we must not expect of <i>Baronius</i>. The only Argument, if it may
be so called, which he pretends to offer on this Occasion, is, that he
cannot conceive <i>Athanasius</i>, and the other holy Confessors, would
have taken upon them to act as they did, and enact a Decree extending
to the whole Church, had they not received such a Power from
him, to whom all Power was given<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c015'><sup>[976]</sup></a>, meaning the Pope. The other
Pieces, falsly ascribed to <i>Liberius</i>, are another Letter to <i>Athanasius</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and one to all the Catholic Bishops; which are both reputed supposititious,
being dated by Consuls who never existed.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Liberius</i> was succeeded by <i>Damasus</i>, whom the <i>Spanish</i>
Writers, upon the Authority of <i>Anastasius</i>, suppose to have been
a Native of <i>Spain</i><a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c015'><sup>[977]</sup></a>; though there is no room to doubt of his being
born in <i>Rome</i>, since it appears, from an Inscription quoted by <i>Baronius</i><a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c015'><sup>[978]</sup></a>,
that his Father had been Lector, Deacon, and Presbyter, of
the Church of St. <i>Laurence</i> in that City, and consequently must have
lived there from his Youth. <i>Damasus</i> had a Sister named <i>Irene</i>, who
embraced the State of Virginity, and died before she was Twenty, as
we read in her Epitaph<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c015'><sup>[979]</sup></a>. It is not therefore probable, that her Death
happened in the Twelfth Year of her Brother’s Pontificate, as the
<i>Spanish</i> Author of her Life tells us, he being then Seventy. <i>Damasus</i>
served, as his Father had done, the Church of St. <i>Laurence</i>, till he
was stricken in Years; for he was upwards of Sixty when raised to
the Episcopal Dignity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and Deacon of that<br/>Church</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He was Deacon of <i>Rome</i> in 355. when <i>Liberius</i>
was sent into Exile; on which Occasion he not only bound
himself, with the rest of the Clergy, by a solemn Oath not to acknowlege
any other Bishop so long as <i>Liberius</i> lived, but attended
him on his Journey to the Place of his Banishment<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c015'><sup>[980]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Whether he aban-<br/>doned</i> Liberius,<i>and<br/>sided with</i> Felix.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Marcellinus</i>
and <i>Faustinus</i> seem to insinuate, that soon afterwards, giving way to
his Ambition, he forgot the Oath he had taken, abandoned <i>Liberius</i>,
for whom he had professed the greatest Friendship, and sided with <i>Felix</i>
his Antagonist<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c015'><sup>[981]</sup></a>. But these Two Presbyters were zealous Partisans
of the Antipope <i>Ursinus</i>, of whom hereafter; and therefore we ought
to be very cautious of what they write to the Prejudice of <i>Damasus</i>.
<i>Jerom</i>, who lived then at <i>Rome</i>, and in great Intimacy with <i>Damasus</i>,
reproaches such of the Ecclesiastics as forsook <i>Liberius</i>, and
joined <i>Felix</i>, with the Breach of a most solemn Oath; styles them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Perjurers, Deserters, Time-servers, <i>&amp;c.</i> which I cannot think he
would have done so freely, had <i>Damasus</i> been one of the Number.
I am therefore not a little surprised, that <i>Baronius</i> should blindly acquiesce
to the Accounts of the above-mentioned Writers, and, without
further Inquiry, condemn <i>Damasus</i> as guilty of Perjury, by ranking
him among the Followers of <i>Felix</i><a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c015'><sup>[982]</sup></a>. And yet the Annalist supposes
him to have been appointed Great Vicar of <i>Rome</i> by <i>Liberius</i>,
upon his withdrawing from the City to avoid the Persecution raised
by <i>Constantius</i> after the Council of <i>Rimini</i><a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c015'><sup>[983]</sup></a>: so that, according
to him, he must have changed Sides anew, and, abandoning <i>Felix</i>,
returned to <i>Liberius</i>, which is representing him as a Man swayed by
no other Principles but those of Interest and Ambition, and therefore
always siding with those who were uppermost. This is all we know
of <i>Damasus</i> before his Election.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He is chosen Bishop<br/>of</i> Rome, <i>and likewise</i><br/>Ursinus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Liberius</i> dying on the 23d or 24th of <i>September</i> 366. as I have related
above, great Disturbances were raised in <i>Rome</i> by the Election
of Two Bishops to succeed him, <i>viz.</i> <i>Damasus</i> and <i>Ursinus</i>, whom
the later Writers style <i>Ursicinus</i>, a Deacon of that Church. This
double Election gave Rise to a dangerous Schism, and a kind of Civil
War, within the Walls of the City, which did not end without a great
deal of Bloodshed. I shall impartially relate what I find concerning
this important Transaction in the contemporary Writers of either Side;
leaving the Reader to judge which of the Two Pretenders was the
Cause of so much Mischief, and which legally chosen. I shall begin
with the Account which <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>, who were then
at <i>Rome</i>, give us of these Elections. They were both Presbyters of
that Church, but, being strict Followers of <i>Lucifer</i> Bishop of <i>Cagliari</i>,
of whom I have spoken above, they and their whole Party were deemed
Schismatics, and consequently cruelly persecuted by the Catholic Bishops,
especially <i>Damasus</i>. Finding themselves thus oppressed, the
Two Presbyters, between 383. and 388. drew up a Petition in Behalf
of themselves and their afflicted Brethren, addressed to <i>Valentinian</i> II.
<i>Theodosius</i>, and <i>Arcadius</i>, intreating those Princes to protect their
Innocence, and put a Stop to the unbridled Rage of their Enemies.
With this Request the Two Presbyters repaired to <i>Constantinople</i>, being
driven from <i>Rome</i> by <i>Damasus</i>, and there presented it to <i>Theodosius</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>who, pitying their Condition, in his Rescript directed to <i>Cynegius</i>
the <i>Præfectus Prætorio</i>, treated them as Catholics, granted
them the free Exercise of their Religion, and declared all those wicked
Men, nay, and Heretics, who had presumed, or should for the
future presume, to persecute or molest them<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c015'><sup>[984]</sup></a>. In the Preface, prefixed
to this Petition, I find the following Account of both the above-mentioned
Elections. <i>Ursinus</i>, say they, was chosen in the Basilic of
<i>Julius</i> by the Deacons <i>Amantius</i> and <i>Lupus</i>, and the People, who
had continued in the Communion of <i>Liberius</i>; but <i>Damasus</i>, by
those who had adhered to <i>Felix</i>, assembled for that Purpose in the
Church of St. <i>Laurence</i>, called <i>in Lucinis</i>. <i>Ursinus</i> was ordained
the first, by <i>Paul</i> Bishop of <i>Tivoli</i>; which <i>Damasus</i>, who had always
panted after the Episcopal Dignity, no sooner knew, than he
hired a great Number of Chariot drivers, and other such despicable
Wretches, who, violently breaking into the Basilic of <i>Julius</i>, massacred
a great many People there. Seven Days afterwards they made themselves
Masters of the <i>Lateran</i> Basilic, and there was <i>Damasus</i> ordained
Bishop<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c015'><sup>[985]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Different Accounts of<br/>these Elections.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Account charges <i>Damasus</i> alone with the Schism,
and the Evils attending it. On the other hand, the Council of <i>Rome</i>,
held about Twelve Years after, lays the whole Blame on <i>Ursinus</i>, who,
say they, boldly attempted to usurp a Dignity, which on no Score
was due to him<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c015'><sup>[986]</sup></a>; and that which met at <i>Aquileia</i> in 381. and consisted
of all the most eminent Bishops of the West, ascribes to <i>Ursinus</i>,
and his Temerity, the many Calamities the Church had suffered;
paints him as a Man of no Credit, Character, or Reputation; and
adds, that he seized by Force what he had no Hopes of attaining by
lawful Means<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c015'><sup>[987]</sup></a>. <i>Ambrose</i> writes, that the Suffrage of Heaven concurred
in the Election of <i>Damasus</i><a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c015'><sup>[988]</sup></a>. According to these Authorities
<i>Damasus</i> was lawfully elected, and <i>Ursinus</i> unlawfully. As to the
Particulars of his Election, <i>Jerom</i>, who perhaps was then at <i>Rome</i>,
tells us, that <i>Damasus</i> was first chosen, and then <i>Ursinus</i>, who, after
his Election, seized by Force on the Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i><a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c015'><sup>[989]</sup></a>, that is, according
to the most probable Opinion, the Basilic of <i>Liberius</i>, now
<i>Saint Mary the Greater</i>. <i>Socrates</i> says, that <i>Ursinus</i> having near as
many Votes as <i>Damasus</i>, he was thereby encouraged to hold separate
Assemblies, and to get himself ordained in a dark and retired Corner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i><a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c015'><sup>[990]</sup></a>. <i>Ruffinus</i> assures us, that <i>Damasus</i> was already
ordained, when <i>Ursinus</i>, transported with Rage at his being
preferred to him, assembled a great Number of seditious People, and,
supported by them, caused himself, in Defiance of the Canons of the
Church, to be ordained, in the Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i>, by <i>Paul</i> Bishop of
<i>Tivoli</i>; whereas the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> were always ordained and consecrated
by those of <i>Ostia</i>. After his Consecration, continues this
Author, he ordained several Persons; which was adding a Sacrilege
to his unlawful Election<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c015'><sup>[991]</sup></a>. Both <i>Ruffinus</i>, and <i>Socrates</i>, who follows
him, were certainly mistaken as to the Place of this Ordination, since
we are told by <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>, that <i>Ursinus</i> was ordained,
not in the Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i>, but in that of <i>Julius</i><a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c015'><sup>[992]</sup></a>. These Two
Writers, who were in <i>Rome</i> at the Time of the Elections, tell us, in
express Terms, that <i>Ursinus</i> was chosen before <i>Damasus</i>; and <i>Jerom</i>,
who was probably in <i>Rome</i> at the same Time, assures us, in Terms no
less express, that <i>Damasus</i> was chosen before <i>Ursinus</i>. The former
were greatly addicted to <i>Ursinus</i>, and the latter no less attached to
<i>Damasus</i>. As for the Two Councils, which I have quoted above,
they were held some Years after, when the Party of <i>Damasus</i> had
universally prevailed, and it was a Crime to acknowlege <i>Ursinus</i>.
<i>Jerom</i> has been followed by most of the Writers who came after, and
the Authority of the other Two quite disregarded, for no other Reason
but because they were Schismatics; for they joined <i>Lucifer</i>, as I
have observed above, and refused to communicate with the Bishops who
had signed the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>, nay, and with those who communicated
with them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Great Disturbances in</i><br/>Rome, <i>occasioned by<br/>this double Election</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>By this double Election the Citizens of <i>Rome</i> saw themselves, before
they were aware, involved in a Civil War. The whole People
were divided, some siding with <i>Damasus</i>, and some with <i>Ursinus</i>;
and neither of the Competitors shewed the least Inclination to yield
to the other. No Day passed without Skirmishes and Bloodshed; insomuch
that <i>Juventius</i> Governor of the City, and <i>Julian</i> the <i>Præfectus
Annonæ</i>, to put a Stop to the present, and prevent greater Disturbances,
agreed to banish <i>Ursinus</i>, whose Party seemed less powerful,
together with his Two Deacons <i>Amantius</i> and <i>Lupus</i>. The Two
Authors I have often quoted write, that both <i>Juventius</i> and <i>Julian</i>
were bribed by <i>Damasus</i>, who, taking Advantage of the Absence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>his Competitor, armed his Followers with Clubs and Swords, hoping
thus to intimidate the Friends of the exiled Bishop, and bring them in
the End to acknowlege him. Seven Presbyters of the Party of <i>Ursinus</i>
were seized, at the Request of <i>Damasus</i>, in order to be sent into
Exile, but rescued by the People of the same Party, and carried in
Triumph to the Basilic of <i>Liberius</i>; which <i>Damasus</i> no sooner heard,
than, arming all his Followers, both Clergy and Laymen, with Clubs,
Swords, Axes, <i>&amp;c.</i> he marched at the Head of the seditious and enraged
Multitude to the Basilic, which he and his Partisans immediately
invested, and attacked with the utmost Fury. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Several Persons<br/>massacred.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It was set on fire in
several Places; the Doors were forced, the Roof uncovered, and
thence Showers of Tiles discharged on the People assembled there:
great was the Massacre; One hundred and Sixty Persons, Men and
Women, were inhumanly murdered on the Side of <i>Ursinus</i>, and a
great many more wounded, some of whom died of their Wounds.
On the Side of <i>Damasus</i> not one single Person was killed. This
Riot began on the 25th of <i>October</i> 366. at Eight in the Morning.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Sedition becomes<br/>general.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Thus the above-mentioned Writer<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c015'><sup>[993]</sup></a> <i>Ruffinus</i> writes in general
Terms, that the illegal Election of <i>Ursinus</i>, in Opposition to <i>Damasus</i>,
occasioned such a Tumult, or rather Civil War among the People,
some siding with the one, and some with the other, that the Places
destined for Prayer streamed with Human Blood<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c015'><sup>[994]</sup></a>. The Heathen <i>Ammianus
Marcellinus</i> assures us, that the Partisans of <i>Damasus</i> and <i>Ursinus</i>
were so implacably incensed against each other, that several Persons
were wounded in the Quarrel, and some killed: nay, it is certain,
adds he, that in the Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i> One hundred and Thirty-seven
Persons were found dead, all killed the same Day: but <i>Damasus</i>
in the End, by the Efforts of his Party, got the better of his Antagonist<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c015'><sup>[995]</sup></a>.
<i>Jerom</i>, however partial, owns, that <i>Ursinus</i> having got Possession of the
Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i>, the Partisans of <i>Damasus</i> repaired thither in Crouds,
and that several Persons were thereupon inhumanly massacred<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c015'><sup>[996]</sup></a>. The
Sedition became general, and the Seditious on either Side so numerous
and powerful, that <i>Juventius</i>, not thinking it adviseable to punish,
nor being able to appease, the enraged Populace, abandoned the City,
and retired to the Country<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c015'><sup>[997]</sup></a>. He was perhaps for <i>Ursinus</i>, whose
Party being over-matched by that of <i>Damasus</i>, he might not think it
safe to continue in <i>Rome</i>. Three Days after the Massacre in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Basilic of <i>Liberius</i>, that is, on the 28th of <i>October</i>, the Partisans of
<i>Ursinus</i>, say <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i>, assembling, cried out aloud
against <i>Damasus</i>, complaining of his Conduct, and begging that a
sufficient Number of Bishops might be convened, and the Controversy
referred to their Judgment and Decision<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c015'><sup>[998]</sup></a>. <i>Damasus</i> was
greatly favoured, and chiefly supported, by the <i>Roman</i> Ladies, which
probably gave Occasion to the Charge of Adultery that was brought
against him. But <i>Jerom</i>, either to clear him of this Charge, or to
obviate the like Suspicions, naturally arising from his familiar Conversation
with the Female Sex, styles him a <i>Virgin Doctor of the
Virgin Church</i><a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c015'><sup>[999]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Damasus <i>not easily<br/> cleared from all<br/>Guilt</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i>, finding he can neither disguise nor extenuate the Cruelties
committed by those who adhered to <i>Damasus</i>, is at a great deal
of Trouble to disculpate him, and lay the whole Blame on <i>Maximinus</i>,
who, as appears from History, discharged the Office of <i>Præfectus
Annonæ</i> from the Latter-end of the Year 367. to the Beginning
of 370. and was noted for his Cruelty. <i>Baronius</i> is supported
herein by the Authority of <i>Jerom</i> and <i>Ruffinus</i>, of whom the former
writes, that <i>Damasus</i> remained Conqueror, without hurting the Conquered<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c015'><sup>[1000]</sup></a>;
and the latter, that the Cruelties practised by the Prefect
<i>Maximinus</i>, who had espoused the Cause of <i>Damasus</i>, upon those of
the adverse Party, rendered the Name of that virtuous Prelate odious,
though he had no Share in them<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c015'><sup>[1001]</sup></a>. But who is to be charged with
the Massacre in the Basilic of <i>Sicinus</i> or <i>Liberius</i>? On whom are the
Murders to be laid, committed there? <i>Maximinus</i> was not then in
Power, and perhaps not at <i>Rome</i>. I cannot help thinking but <i>Damasus</i>
might at least have restrained his Followers from such Excesses;
and consequently, as he did not, I cannot, with <i>Ruffinus</i>, conclude
him to have had no Share in them; I say, <i>at least restrained</i>; for I
will not charge him with heading and encouraging the riotous Multitude
in that wicked Attempt, upon the bare Authority of <i>Marcellinus</i>
and <i>Faustinus</i>, both zealous Partisans of <i>Ursinus</i>. But neither
ought <i>Baronius</i>, <i>Bellarmine</i>, <i>Davidius</i>, &amp;c. upon the bare Testimony
of Two Writers, no less sanguine in the Cause of <i>Damasus</i>, suppose
him to have been no-ways concerned in those Disorders. The famous
<i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>, who lived at this very time in <i>Rome</i>, and, as
a Pagan, was no-ways concerned in the Quarrel, nor more inclined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>to one Side than the other, assures us, that both were equally ambitious
of the Episcopal Dignity, and both equally guilty<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c015'><sup>[1002]</sup></a>. The
Authority of a Writer, thus unbyassed, and in every other respect
unexceptionable, ought to be preferred, without the least Hesitation,
to that of any other, whom we have just Reason to suspect of Partiality.
<i>Jerom</i> indeed speaks with more Modesty and Reserve than
<i>Ruffinus</i>, and those who have copied after him; for he only says,
that <i>Damasus</i> did not hurt his Enemies after he had conquered
them. But, in relating the above-mentioned Massacre, and the Skirmishes
that happened before the Party of <i>Damasus</i> prevailed, he always
describes his Partisans as the Aggressors, without ever pretending
to excuse him, as having no Share in those Riots; which he would
not have failed to do, had he not paid a greater Regard to Truth than
<i>Ruffinus</i> seems to have done.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Luxury of the<br/>Bishops of</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Heathen <i>Marcellinus</i>, after telling us, that <i>Damasus</i> and <i>Ursinus</i>
aspired with equal Ambition to the Episcopal Chair, adds this
famous Remark, which I shall set down in his own Words: <i>I must
own</i>, says he, <i>that when I reflect on the Pomp attending that Dignity,
I do not at all wonder, that those, who are fond of Shew and
Parade, should scold, quarrel, fight, and strain every Nerve to attain
it; since they are sure, if they succeed, to be enriched with the Offerings
of the Ladies; to appear no more abroad on foot, but in
stately Chariots, and gorgeously attired; to keep costly and sumptuous
Tables; nay, and to surpass the Emperors themselves in the Splendor
and Magnificence of their Entertainments. But how happy
would they be, if, despising the Grandeur of the City, which they
allege to excuse their Luxury, they followed the Example of some
Bishops in the Provinces, who, by the Temperance and Frugality of
their Diet, the Poverty and Plainness of their Dress, the Modesty
of their Looks fixed on the Ground, the Purity of their Lives, and
the Regularity of their whole Conduct, approve themselves to the
eternal God, and all his true Worshipers</i><a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c015'><sup>[1003]</sup></a>! Thus <i>Ammianus</i>. And
that <i>Damasus</i> was fond of all that Pomp, Grandeur, and Parade, that
he led such a voluptuous Life, as <i>Ammianus</i> here so justly censures
and condemns in the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, is not to be doubted, since
<i>Prætextatus</i>, a Man of the first Quality, honoured with the greatest
Employments of the Empire, and zealously attached to Paganism, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>conversing familiarly with him, used pleasantly to say, <i>Make me Bishop
of</i> Rome, <i>and I'll immediately turn Christian</i><a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c015'><sup>[1004]</sup></a>. But, as I shall
have Occasion to speak of this Subject hereafter, I shall only observe
here, that the Offerings of those devout Women, and other pious
Christians, were no better employed in the Days of <i>Damasus</i>, than
the immense Wealth, which the Church of <i>Rome</i> acquired in After-Ages,
by the voluntary Contributions of all the Christian Nations, is
disposed of in ours. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How the Oblations of<br/>the Faithful disposed<br/>of.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With these Offerings the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> used
in more early Times, to maintain the Poor of their own Church, and
send the Overplus to other Churches, where the Poor were numerous,
and the Offerings small. Of this generous Practice I have mentioned
some Instances, that well deserve to be recorded. But when Ambition
began to take place of Charity, the Poor were forgotten, and
nothing thought of but splendid Equipages, numerous Retinues,
princely Apparel, sumptuous Tables, and whatever else could feed
the Vanity of these upstart Princes, and put them upon the Level with
the greatest Monarchs. To such Purposes were the Oblations of the
Faithful perverted. <i>Baronius</i> takes it very much amiss of <i>Ammianus</i>,
that he should find Fault with the costly Tables and Entertainments
of the Popes, since it is manifest from St. <i>Austin</i>, that the Christians
at <i>Rome</i>, and, no doubt, the Pope with the rest, kept a rigorous Fast
Three Days in the Week<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c015'><sup>[1005]</sup></a>; so that, in his Opinion, they ought not
to be blamed for rioting Four Days in the Week, provided they fasted
Three. But to this Doctrine <i>Ammianus</i> was a Stranger, and therefore,
notwithstanding the Fasts they might keep, he justly censured
their expensive Tables and Banquets, as no-ways suited to their Profession
and Character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ursinus <i>recalled by</i><br/>Valentinian;</div>

<p class='c001'>But to return to <i>Ursinus</i>; he had been banished <i>Rome</i> by the Prefect
<i>Juventius</i>, before the 26th of <i>October</i> 366. as I have related
above; but the Emperor <i>Valentinian</i>, who was at this time in <i>Gaul</i>,
having, at the Request of his Friends, granted him Leave to return,
he entered the City on the 15th of <i>September</i> 367. in a kind of
Triumph, being met and received with loud Acclamations by those
of his Party<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c015'><sup>[1006]</sup></a>. At the same time the Emperor directed a Rescript to
<i>Prætextatus</i>, who had succeeded <i>Juventius</i> in the Prefecture of
<i>Rome</i>, injoining him to recall all those, who had been banned for
the late Riots, and reinstate them in their former Condition, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>warning them, that if, for the future, they disturbed the Peace of the
Public, they should be punished without Mercy<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c015'><sup>[1007]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but banished anew</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But notwithstanding
this Warning, new Disturbances must have happened, since <i>Ursinus</i>
was, by an Order from the Emperor, banished again on the
16th of <i>November</i> of the same Year 367. together with Seven of his
Followers, who were all confined to different Places in <i>Gaul</i>, where
they continued till the Year 371<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c015'><sup>[1008]</sup></a>. The Two Presbyters tell us, that
<i>Damasus</i>, having, with large Sums, gained the Ministers and Favourites
at Court, by their Means extorted from the Emperor the above-mentioned
Order. They add, that the Friends of <i>Ursinus</i> were resolved
to stand by him; but that he, to prevent Bloodshed, delivered
himself up into the Hands of the Officers of Justice<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c015'><sup>[1009]</sup></a>. However that
be, by the Banishment of <i>Ursinus</i>, and some of the leading Men of
his Party, Tranquillity was restored for a while, and the Disturbances
composed, says <i>Ammianus</i>, which the Christians had raised by quarreling
among themselves<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c015'><sup>[1010]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Bishop of</i> Rome<br/><i>impowered by the<br/>Emperor to judge<br/>other Bishops</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>About this Time the Emperor <i>Valentinian</i> enacted a Law, impowering
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> to examine and judge other Bishops,
that religious and ecclesiastical Disputes might not be decided by profane
or secular Judges, but by a <i>Pontiff of the same Religion, and
his Collegues</i><a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c015'><sup>[1011]</sup></a>. A very imprudent Law, considering the Nature and
Consequences of such a Concession. The Bishops assembled in Council
at <i>Rome</i>, in 378. after declaring, in the strongest Terms, their Approbation
of this Law, agreed to present an Address to the Emperor
<i>Gratian</i>, wherein they earnestly recommended to him the Execution
of it, because it greatly redounded, say they, to the Honour of the
sacred Ministry; because the Judgment of Bishops was more sure and
certain than that of any Civil Magistrate; and, lastly, because it delivered
the Prelates of the Church from the just Concern they were
under, to find that they could not make their Innocence appear
without Racks and Tortures, which innocent Persons were put to by
the Secular Judges<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c015'><sup>[1012]</sup></a>. This Exemption seems to have been understood
by the Council as extending to all Cases, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical.
Be that as it will, whatever Exemption was by the above-mentioned
Law granted to the Bishops, whatever Power was by that
Law vested in the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and his Collegues, the Council,
with a due Sense of Gratitude, acknowleged such Power and Immunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to be intirely owing to the Indulgence of the Emperor: a plain
Proof that the absurd and chimerical Notion of a <i>Divine Right</i> was
not yet broached. The Bishops chose rather to be judged by the
Pope and his Collegues, that is, by their own Brethren, than by Lay
Judges, for the Reasons they allege in their Address to <i>Gratian</i>.
Hence they chearfully submitted to his Judgment, and applauded
every new Power that was granted him, as redounding to the Honour
of the Episcopal Order. But, alas! they were not aware, that
every new Power, yielded to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, was a new Link
added to the Chain they were forging, if not for themselves, for
those, at least, who were to succeed them. They little apprehended,
that the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> would, in Process of Time, claim all the
Power vested in him, and his Collegues, as due to him alone, and
that too by <i>Divine Right</i>; that, in virtue of such a Claim, he would
set up for universal and sole Monarch of the Church, exercise an unbounded
Authority and Jurisdiction, and degrade all other Bishops
from his Collegues to his Vassals and Slaves. <i>Blondel</i> is of Opinion,
that the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> was, by that Law, only impowered to judge
the Bishops within the Limits of his Jurisdiction, that is, those of
the Suburbicarian Provinces<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c015'><sup>[1013]</sup></a>. Others think that such a Power was
only for a time, and extended to those Bishops alone who were concerned
in the present Schism; which seems most probable, since <i>Valentinian</i>
declares, that he enacted the above-mentioned Law to settle
the Church, shaken by the Fury of the Schism<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c015'><sup>[1014]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Followers of</i><br/>Ursinus <i>driven out of</i><br/>Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Ursinus</i>, and the leading Men of his Party, being driven out of
the City, the Inhabitants began to enjoy their former Peace and Tranquillity.
But yet his Followers continued to assemble in the C&oelig;meteries
of the Martyrs, and even kept Possession of a Church, supposed
to be that of St. <i>Agnes</i>, without the Walls<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c015'><sup>[1015]</sup></a>. Of this <i>Damasus</i> took
care to transmit an Account to the Emperor, in a Memorial; who,
fearing that, from such a Spark, the Fire might break out again, which
he had been striving to extinguish, injoined <i>Prætextatus</i> to put <i>Damasus</i>
forthwith in Possession of that Church; and, in the Execution
of this Order, probably happened what we find related, perhaps with
some Exaggeration, by the Two Writers I have often quoted; for
they tell us, that one Day, while the Followers of <i>Ursinus</i> were assembled,
in great Numbers, in the Church of <i>St. Agnes</i>, <i>Damasus</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>falling unexpectedly upon them with his Satellites, made a dreadful Havock
of the innocent and defenceless Multitude<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c015'><sup>[1016]</sup></a>. After this Second
Massacre <i>Prætextatus</i>, to secure the Tranquillity of the City, sent
several more of the Party of <i>Ursinus</i> into Exile. <i>Valentinian</i>, however,
would not consent to their being confined to any particular Place;
but gave them full Liberty to live where they pleased, provided they
kept out of <i>Rome</i><a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c015'><sup>[1017]</sup></a>. The two Writers add, that the Cruelties exercised
in the Church of <i>St. Agnes</i> gave great Offence to the Bishops
of <i>Italy</i>; and that <i>Damasus</i> having invited some of them to <i>Rome</i>,
to solemnize with him the Anniversary of his Consecration, he laid
hold of that Opportunity to solicit them with Intreaties, nay, and to
tempt them with Money, to condemn <i>Ursinus</i>; but all in vain; the
Bishops equally unmoved by his Prayers and Offers, refusing, with
great Firmness and Resolution, to condemn a Man whom they had
not heard. <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i> close their Preface with a short
Account of themselves, telling us, that the Presbyters of <i>Ursinus</i>’s
Party were imprisoned, racked, banished, dispersed, and sent into
different Countries; and that they themselves, who were of that
Number, presented a Petition to the Emperors, begging them to put
a Stop to so cruel a Persecution<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c015'><sup>[1018]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Damasus <i>assembles a<br/>Council at</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Damasus</i> having thus, in the End, by the Favour of the Emperors,
intirely got the better of the adverse Party, and secured his Dignity,
he turned his Thoughts to Ecclesiastical Matters. In the West there
were now but Three Bishops, who still maintained the Doctrine of
<i>Arius</i>; <i>viz.</i> <i>Ursacius</i> Bishop of <i>Singidunum</i>, <i>Valens</i> of <i>Mursa</i>, and
<i>Auxentius</i> of <i>Milan</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Ursacius <i>and</i> Valens<br/><i>condemned</i>.<br/>Auxentius <i>why spared</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Damasus</i>, however, convened a numerous
Council at <i>Rome</i>; and there examined anew, and anew condemned,
the Tenets of <i>Arius</i>, and all who held them, namely <i>Ursacius</i> and
<i>Valens</i><a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c015'><sup>[1019]</sup></a>. <i>Auxentius</i> was a pure, and no less zealous, <i>Arian</i>, than
either of these Two; but as he was in favour with <i>Valentinian</i>,
whom he had deceived by an equivocal Confession of Faith, <i>Damasus</i>,
and his Council, thought it adviseable not to name him. The
Council writ a synodal Letter to the other Bishops, acquainting them
with what had passed; which was answered by <i>Athanasius</i>, and the
Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, then assembled at <i>Alexandria</i>. In their Answer
they thank <i>Damasus</i> for condemning <i>Ursacius</i> and <i>Valens</i>; but, at
the same time, express no small Surprize to find, that <i>Auxentius</i> was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>not yet deposed, tho’ guilty not only of <i>Arianism</i>, but of many other
Crimes, which they enumerate<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c015'><sup>[1020]</sup></a>. <i>Damasus</i> and his Collegues paid,
no doubt, great Regard to the Remonstrances of <i>Athanasius</i>; but, as
<i>Auxentius</i> was supported by the Emperor, and they were better
Courtiers than <i>Athanasius</i>, they never attempted to depose him; nay,
they carried their Complaisance so far as to condemn <i>Ursacius</i> and
<i>Valens</i>, as if they had been the only <i>Arian</i> Bishops in the West, without
ever naming <i>Auxentius</i>. He therefore kept, for many Years,
quiet Possession of the See he had usurped, and was at last deprived of
it by Death alone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Avarice of the</i><br/>Roman <i>Clergy<br/>restrained by</i><br/>Valentinian.</div>

<p class='c001'>The many Abuses and Disorders, that reigned at this Time among
the Ecclesiastics of <i>Rome</i>, offered a larger Field to the Zeal of <i>Damasus</i>,
than the Heresy of <i>Arius</i>, now confined in the West to a
Corner of <i>Illyricum</i>. But he was by no means a fit Person to set up
for a Reformer of Manners, and the Evil required a more powerful
Remedy than he could apply. The Prelates of the Church, even the
Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, could yet only preach against Vice, admonish the
Vicious, and inflict ecclesiastical Censures on such as gave no Ear to
their Admonitions: all other Power was still lodged in Lay Hands,
and only imparted to the Ecclesiastics in some extraordinary Cases.
The insatiable Avarice of the <i>Roman</i> <a id='corr190.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Clergy'>Clergy,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_190.11'><ins class='correction' title='Clergy'>Clergy,</ins></a></span> the mean and scandalous
Arts they were daily practising to circumvent the Orphans,
plunder the Widows, and rob the lawful Heirs of their just Inheritance,
cried loudly for a Reform; but were Evils too strong for the
Curb of Exhortation, Admonition, or Censures merely ecclesiastical;
and <i>Damasus</i> himself was not quite free from Imputations of
this Nature. It was therefore necessary, that the Secular Power should
interpose in Defence of the deluded Laity, against the Craft and Rapines
of the ravenous Clergy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Law enacted by him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  A Law was accordingly enacted by
the Emperor <i>Valentinian</i>, in the Year 370. addressed to <i>Damasus</i>
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and read, on the 29th of <i>July</i>, in all the Churches
of that City, strictly forbidding the Ecclesiastics, and such as
professed Celibacy, meaning the Monks, to frequent the Houses of
Orphans or Widows, or to accept from those, whom they attended
under the Veil of Religion, any thing whatsoever by way of Donation,
Legacy, or Feoffment in Trust. Whatever was thus given or
accepted, is declared forfeited to the public Treasury<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c015'><sup>[1021]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>This Law, taken in a literal Sense, only forbids the Ecclesiastics to
accept such Donations as were made by the Women whom they attended
in spiritual Matters as their Guides or Directors; but it was either
understood and interpreted as extending to all Donations from pious
Persons, or a new Law was made at this Time excluding the Ecclesiastics
from all such Donations, as plainly appears from <i>Jerom</i> and
<i>Ambrose</i>, of whom the former, in one of his Letters, writes thus:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Sentiments of St.</i><br/>Jerom <i>and</i> Ambrose<br/><i>concerning this Law</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>I am ashamed to say it, the Priests of the Idols, the Stage-players,
Charioteers, Whores, are capable of inheriting Estates, and receiving
Legacies; from this common Privilege, Clerks alone, and Monks,
are debarred by Law; debarred, not under persecuting Tyrants, but
Christian Princes</i><a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c015'><sup>[1022]</sup></a>. And <i>Ambrose</i>; <i>We are excluded by Laws,
lately enacted, from all Inheritances, Donations, and Legacies; yet
we do not complain: And why should we? By such Laws we only
lose Wealth; and the Loss of Wealth is no Loss to us. Estates are
lawfully bequeathed to the Ministers of the Heathen Temples; no
Layman is excluded, let his Condition be ever so low, let his Life
be ever so scandalous: Clerks alone are debarred of a Right common
to the rest of Mankind. Let a Christian Widow bequeath her
whole Estate to a Pagan Priest, her Will is good in Law; let her
bequeath the least Share of it to a Minister of God, her Will is
null. I do not mention these Things by way of Complaint, but only to
let the World know, that I do not complain; for I had rather we should
want Money, than Virtue or Grace</i><a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c015'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>. From these Testimonies it is
manifest, that either by the above-mentioned Law, or by some other
published at this Time, the Ecclesiastics were restrained from receiving
any Donations or Legacies whatever, by whomsoever bequeathed:
and that such a Law was absolutely necessary, is no less manifest from
the unquestionable Authority of <i>Jerom</i>, who lived at this very Time
in <i>Rome</i>, and describes, as an Eye-witness, the Arts that were practised
with great Success, by the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, to circumvent rich Widows,
and old Men. <i>The Clerks</i>, says he, <i>who ought to instruct and awe
the Women with a grave and composed Behaviour, first kiss their
Heads, and then, stretching out their Hand, as it were to bestow a
Blessing, slily receive a Fee for their Salutation. The Women in the
mean time, elated with Pride in seeing themselves thus courted by the
Clergy, prefer the Freedom of Widowhood to the Subjection attending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the State of Matrimony. Some of the Clergy make it the whole
Business and Employment of their Lives to learn the Names of the
Ladies, to find out their Habitations, to study their Humour. One
of these</i> (perhaps <i>Antimus</i> or <i>Sophronius</i>, two Monkish Harpyes, of
whom he speaks elsewhere), <i>an Adept in the Art, rises with the
Sun, settles the Order of his Visits, acquaints himself with the
shortest Ways, and almost breaks into the Rooms of the Women before
they are awake. If he sees any curious Piece of Houshold Furniture,
he extols, admires, and handles it; and, sighing that he too should
stand in need of such Trifles, in the End, rather extorts it by Force,
than obtains it by Goodwill, the Ladies being afraid to disoblige the
prating old Fellow, that is always running about from House to
House<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c015'><sup>[1024]</sup></a>.</i> The same Writer, speaking elsewhere of the Monks, displays
the Arts which they practised to deceive, captivate, and plunder,
the rich Widows, and old Men; and adds, that, by professing Poverty,
they were become rich, and that the Church grieved to see many acquire
great Wealth by serving her, who had been Beggars, while they
lived in the World<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c015'><sup>[1025]</sup></a>. So that the Monastic Profession was in those
early Times what it is now, a gainful Trade, under the Mask of Religion.
As for the mean, nay, and nauseous Offices, to which they
were prompted by their Avarice, and the greedy Expectation of Legacies,
to submit, about the childless old Men and Women in their
Sickness, it would be forgetting the Dignity of an Historian to mention
them. The Reader will find them described by <i>Jerom</i>, and perhaps
too minutely, in the Letter he writ to his Friend <i>Nepotian</i><a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c015'><sup>[1026]</sup></a>.
In the same Letter he informs us, how the Wealth thus acquired was
disposed of. <i>I</i>, says he, applying to himself what he levelled at
others, to render the Truth he spoke less disagreeable; <i>I, who was
born in a poor Country Cottage, who had scarce Millet enough, and
coarse Bread, to satiate my craving Stomach, now despise the finest
Flour, the choicest Honey, am well acquainted with the different
Kinds and Names of Fishes, and can tell by the Taste from what
Coast each Shell-fish was brought, from what Province each Bird<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c015'><sup>[1027]</sup></a>.</i>
A Law was therefore necessary to restrain the insatiable Avarice of the
<i>Roman</i> Clergy, and obviate the unhallowed Use they made of the
Wealth, which by such scandalous Means they had acquired. This
Law <i>Jerom</i> calls a Caustic; and adds, that he does not complain of
it, but of the Sore that required it<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c015'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>. However, that he complains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and <i>Ambrose</i> too, not only of the Sore, but the Caustic, is manifest
from their Words, and Manner of writing. To exaggerate the pretended
Hardship, they both observe, that the Pagan Priests lay under
no such Restraints: An unseasonable Observation! Since it shews the
Difference between the Pagan and Christian Priesthood in a mortifying
Light. The former gave no Occasion to such a Law, their Avarice
wanted no such Restraints; if it had, we may be sure they had met
with no Quarter from a Christian, nay, from an Orthodox Prince;
and if he had spared them, such Partiality had not been tamely put
up, and passed over in Silence, by the Ecclesiastical Writers of those
Times, namely, by the Two I have mentioned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>That Law probably<br/>not procured by</i><br/>Damasus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i> is of Opinion, that the above-mentioned Law was procured

and his Successors, as well as the Spiritual<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c015'><sup>[1029]</sup></a>. Thus he puts at once
both Swords into the Popes Hands, though he has not yet been able to
allege one single Instance of their having either. They got both, 'tis
true, in After-ages; and we shall see, in the Sequel of this History,
how they came by them. But that Law, says <i>Baronius</i>, was read in
all the Churches of <i>Rome</i>. And so have others been, when they
concerned the Clergy, and were addressed to, though not procured
by, the Bishop of that City<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c015'><sup>[1030]</sup></a>. Besides, as <i>Damasus</i> loved Pomp and
Grandeur, it is not at all probable, that he was instrumental in the
enacting of a Law, which deprived him of the main Fund to support
them, the Generosity of the <i>Roman</i> Ladies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>It is extended to<br/>sacred Virgins, and<br/>to Bishops.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Two Years after, that is, in 372. the Law I have mentioned above
was extended by the same Prince, <i>viz.</i> <i>Valentinian</i>, to the sacred
Virgins and Bishops, so as to exclude the former from the Right of
giving, and the latter from that of receiving, any thing whatsoever by
way of Donation, Legacy, <i>&amp;c<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c015'><sup>[1031]</sup></a>.</i> But this Law, with another still
more severe, published Twenty Years afterwards by the Emperor
<i>Theodosius</i>, was abrogated by the Emperor <i>Marcian</i> in the Year 455.
as I shall have Occasion to relate hereafter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The primitive Rigour<br/>and Discipline utterly<br/>neglected at</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In the mean time I cannot
help observing with Astonishment, how early the primitive Rigour
of Discipline and Manners was utterly neglected and forgotten by
the Ecclesiastics of <i>Rome</i>; how early the most exorbitant Luxury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>with all the Vices attending it, was introduced among them, and
the most scandalous and unchristian Arts of acquiring Wealth universally
practised. They seem to have rivalled, in riotous living, the
greatest Epicures of Pagan <i>Rome</i>, when Luxury was there at the highest
Pitch. For <i>Jerom</i>, who was an Eye-witness of what he writ, reproaches
the <i>Roman</i> Clergy with the same Excesses, which the Poet
<i>Juvenal</i> so severely censured in the <i>Roman</i> Nobility, under the Reign
of <i>Domitian</i>. And how much more worthy were the former of the
severest Censure, not only in regard of their Calling, and the Religion
they professed, teaching them to curb and subdue all irregular Passions
and Appetites, but from this aggravating Circumstance, that the Estates
they so squandered and wasted were not their own, but the Patrimony
of the Poor, the Substance of the Orphans, Widows, and unhappy
Persons, whom, under the Cloke of Religion, they robbed of their
just Inheritance! And herein they conformed to the Example of their
Chief, who, finding an inexhaustible Fund in the Generosity of the
<i>Roman</i> Ladies to support his Extravagance, lived in that Pomp and
Grandeur which <i>Ammianus</i> has described above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Orthodox<br/>persecuted in the<br/>East.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But he was roused from the easy and indolent Life he led at <i> Rome</i>,
by Letters from the famous <i>Basil</i>, lately raised to the See of <i>Cæsarea</i>
in <i>Cappadocia</i>, the Metropolis of <i>Pontus</i>, imploring his Assistance,
and that of the other Western Bishops, in the present unhappy Condition
of the Churches in the East. <i>Arianism</i> was almost utterly extirpated
in the West under the Orthodox Emperor <i>Valentinian</i>, as I have
observed above; but in the East it triumphed under his Brother <i>Valens</i>,
a most zealous Favourer of the <i>Arians</i>, a most implacable Enemy to
the Orthodox, who were by him every-where driven from their Sees,
and sent into Exile: nay, he gave full Power to the <i>Arian</i> Bishops and
Magistrates to imprison, fine, beat, rack, and banish, at Pleasure,
such of the Orthodox Clergy as they could not win over by more gentle
Methods. This Power they used so tyrannically, especially at <i>Constantinople</i>,
that the Clergy of that City resolved to apply to <i>Valens</i>
himself for Relief, not doubting but the Miseries they groaned under
might, if duly represented, even move him to Compassion. Accordingly
they appointed Eighty of their Body, all Men of unblemished
Characters, and known Piety, to repair to <i>Nicomedia</i>, where that
Prince then was, and lay their Grievances before him. Upon their
Arrival at Court, they were introduced to the Emperor, who heard
them with great Attention, without shewing the least Emotion either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>of Resentment or Compassion. However, as, upon his dismissing
them, he immediately sent for <i>Modestus</i> the <i>Præfectus Prætorio</i>, they
concluded that he had given Ear to their just Complaints, and began to
expect a speedy Redress of their Grievances. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Inhumanly treated by<br/>the Emperor</i>Valens.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But the Charge he gave
him, very different from what they expected, was to dispatch them all
without Mercy or Delay. The Prefect, apprehending the Death of so
many eminent Ecclesiastics might occasion a Tumult in the City, gave
out that the Emperor had ordered them into Exile; and accordingly
caused them to be put on board a Vessel, in order to be conveyed, as
he pretended, to the Place of their Banishment. But the Vessel was
no sooner out of Sight, than the Mariners, pursuant to their private
Instructions, set Fire to it, and, betaking themselves to their Boat, left
those they had on board to the Mercy of the Flames and Waves<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c015'><sup>[1032]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Orthodox divided<br/>among themselves.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>But <i>Athanasius</i>, <i>Basil</i>, and the other Champions of the Orthodox
Party, were not so much alarmed at the cruel Persecution raised
against them by their Enemies, as at the unhappy Divisions that reigned
at this very time among themselves. It was to procure a Remedy
for these Divisions, to heal a dangerous Schism, that rent the Orthodox
Party into two opposite Factions, that <i>Basil</i>, by the Advice of
<i><a id='corr195.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Aubanasius'>Athanasius</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_195.20'><ins class='correction' title='Aubanasius'>Athanasius</ins></a></span></i>, writ the above-mentioned Letter to <i>Damasus</i>, and
that the Orthodox Bishops of the East writ in common a Letter to all
their Brethren in the West. As this Schism did more Hurt to the
Orthodox Cause than it was in the Power of their Enemies to have
done, I shall not think it foreign to my Purpose to insert a succinct
Account of its Rise and Progress. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>What occasioned<br/>this Division.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Eustathius</i>, the Orthodox Bishop
of <i>Antioch</i>, being deposed by the <i>Arians</i> in 331. and one of their
own Party put in his room, the greater Part of the Clergy and People
of that City, acknowleging the new-chosen Bishop, and his <i>Arian</i>
Successors, assisted at their Assemblies, mixed with the <i>Arians</i>, and
received the Sacraments at their Hands, though they disagreed with
them in Belief. But some more zealous than the rest, refusing to own
any other Bishop so long as <i>Eustathius</i> lived, held their Assemblies
apart, under the Direction of Presbyters animated with the like Zeal.
These, from their steady Attachment to <i>Eustathius</i>, were called <i>Eustathians</i>,
and with them alone <i>Athanasius</i> communicated while he
was at <i>Antioch</i><a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c015'><sup>[1033]</sup></a>. This Schism or Separation continued even after
the Death of <i>Eustathius</i>, those of his Party declining not only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Communion of the <i>Arians</i> and their Bishops, but of the Orthodox, who
communicated with them. In the Year 360. the See of <i>Antioch</i> being
vacant, by the Translation of <i>Eudoxius</i> the <i>Arian</i> to that of <i>Constantinople</i>,
the <i>Arians</i>, and the Orthodox, who communicated with them,
chose with one Consent the famous <i>Meletius</i> to succeed him. Both
Parties joyfully concurred in this Election; the Orthodox, because they
knew his Doctrine to be no less pure than his Manners; and the <i>Arians</i>,
because they hoped, by such a distinguishing Mark of their Friendship
and Esteem, to win him, and by his Means to gain over to their Party
the whole City of <i>Antioch</i>, nay, and the <i>Eustathians</i> themselves<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c015'><sup>[1034]</sup></a>.
But they soon found, to their great Mortification, that the Orthodox
were better acquainted with <i>Meletius</i> than they, that he was most
zealously attached to the Orthodox Party, and was not to be swayed
by Friendship or Enmity, by Hopes or Terrors. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Meletius <i>the new<br/>Bishop of</i> Antioch<br/><i>declares in favour of<br/>the Orthodox</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He was no sooner
installed, which Ceremony was performed with the greatest Solemnity,
than he loudly declared in favour of <i>Consubstantiality</i>, and
boldly cut off from his Communion, as rotten and incurable Members,
all who held the opposite Doctrine. The <i>Arians</i> of <i>Antioch</i>
were thunderstruck with the Boldness of the Attempt; the whole
Party took the Alarm; <i>Eudoxius</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, and the
neighbouring Bishops, forgetful of every thing else, hastened to <i>Antioch</i>;
Hopes, Fears, Prayers, Menaces, were successively employed,
and nothing left unattempted to divert, at least to allay, the impending
Storm. But all in vain; the Zeal of <i>Meletius</i> was incapable of
Controul: he openly declared, that nothing should, nothing could,
make him desist from, or relent in, the Work he had undertaken, till
he had utterly extirpated the <i>Arian</i> Heresy, without leaving the least
Shoot of so poisonous a Weed in the Field, which by Divine Appointment
he was to guard and cultivate<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c015'><sup>[1035]</sup></a>. The <i>Arians</i> finding him immovably
fixed in his Resolution, and, what doubled their Concern, the
whole Party in imminent Danger from one of their own chusing, they
applied with better Success to the Emperor <i>Constantius</i>; and, charging
the new Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> with <i>Sabellianism</i>, which Charge the credulous
and unwary Prince believed upon their Word, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is banished.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  they extorted
from him a Rescript banishing <i>Meletius</i> from <i>Antioch</i> about Thirty
Days after his Installment, and confining him to <i>Melitene</i> in <i>Armenia</i>,
his native City<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c015'><sup>[1036]</sup></a>. <i>Euzoius</i> was preferred in his room, formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the chief Favourite of <i>Arius</i>, and the most antient of all his Disciples;
for together with him he was condemned by the great Council of
<i>Nice</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Great Divisions in<br/>that Church.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Orthodox, who had hitherto communicated with the <i>Arians</i>,
were so disobliged and scandalized at these Proceedings, that, in the
End they renounced the <i>Arian</i> Communion; and, assembling by
themselves, proposed an Union with the <i>Eustathians</i>. But their Proposal
was rejected by the leading Men of that Party, alleging, that
they could not admit them to their Communion, because they had
for so many Years communicated with the <i>Arians</i>, received the Sacraments
at their Hands, and still seemed to acknowlege <i>Meletius</i> as lawful
Bishop, though he had been chosen by the <i>Arian</i> Faction: for
the <i>Eustathians</i>, notwithstanding the heroic Firmness of <i>Meletius</i>
in defending and promoting the common Cause, refused to own him,
for no other Reason but because the <i>Arians</i> had had a chief Share in
his Election<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c015'><sup>[1037]</sup></a>. As this Disagreement greatly weakened the Orthodox
Cause in <i>Antioch</i>, and might, in time, be attended with fatal Consequences,
no Pains were spared by the apostolic Men of those Times,
to induce the <i>Eustathians</i> to abate somewhat of their Zeal and Severity.
As for the other Party, notwithstanding their Attachment
to <i>Meletius</i>, whence they had the Name of <i>Meletians</i>, they were
greatly inclined to an Accommodation, and seemed to court the
Communion of the <i>Eustathians</i>, almost upon any Terms. <i>Lucifer</i>,
the famous Bishop of <i>Cagliari</i>, on his Return from <i>Thebais</i> in <i>Egypt</i>,
to which Place he had been confined by <i>Constantius</i>, was prompted
by his Zeal to take <i>Antioch</i> in his Way, with a Design to mediate an
Accommodation between the dissenting Parties. Being arrived in that
City, he had several Conferences with the leading Men of the one
and the other Party; and, finding neither averse to an Accommodation,
he conceived great Hopes of succeeding in his Design; and therefore
begged the Fathers of the Council of <i>Alexandria</i>, which was
already sitting, and to which he had been invited by <i>Athanasius</i>, to
dispense with his assisting at that Assembly, since his Presence seemed
more necessary at <i>Antioch</i>. However, he appointed Two of his Deacons
to be present as his Deputies, injoining them to agree, in his
Name, to the Decisions of the Council<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c015'><sup>[1038]</sup></a>. <i>Baronius</i> owns here,
which I cannot help observing by the way, that <i>Lucifer</i> never appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>in the Council of <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c015'><sup>[1039]</sup></a>; forgetting, no doubt, what he
elsewhere so strenuously maintains<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c015'><sup>[1040]</sup></a>; <i>viz.</i> that <i>Lucifer</i> assisted at
that Assembly, in the Name of Pope <i>Liberius</i>, and as his Legate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i><br/>Alexandria <i>strive<br/>to heal these Divisions</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Fathers of the Council not only approved of the Bishop of
<i>Cagliari</i>’s Resolution, but appointed <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i>, and <i>Asterius</i>
of <i>Petra</i> in <i>Arabia</i>, to assist him in so pious an Undertaking.
What seemed chiefly to obstruct the so much wished for Union, was
a great Attachment on one Side to <i>Meletius</i>, and an equal Obstinacy
on the other, in refusing to acknowlege one preferred by the <i>Arians</i>.
The Confessors therefore assembled in <i>Alexandria</i> (for of Confessors
alone that Assembly was composed) were of Opinion, that, if every
other Remedy proved ineffectual, their Deputies should apply to <i>Meletius</i>;
and, having persuaded him to resign his Dignity, chuse another
in his room, equally acceptable to both Parties. They did not
in the least doubt but <i>Meletius</i> would readily, nay, with great Joy,
sacrifice his Dignity, and every other private View, to the public
Tranquillity<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c015'><sup>[1041]</sup></a>; so great was the Opinion they entertained of his Virtue.
Had this wise Resolution taken place, it had, in all Likelihood,
been attended with the desired Effect. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>All Means of an<br/>Accommodation cut<br/>off by the imprudent<br/>Conduct of the Bishop<br/>of</i> Cagliari.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But before the Deputies could
reach <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Lucifer</i>, more commendable for Zeal than Prudence,
had cut off all means of an Accommodation, by conferring, of his
own Authority, the Episcopal Dignity on the Presbyter <i>Paulinus</i>, who
was at the Head of the <i>Eustathians</i>, and had with more Warmth
than any other opposed <i>Meletius</i>, and those who adhered to him. He
was assisted in that irregular Ordination by Two other Confessors<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c015'><sup>[1042]</sup></a>;
<i>viz.</i> <i>Gorgonius</i> of <i>Germanicia</i>, and <i>Cymatius</i> of <i>Gabala</i>, or rather of
<i>Paltos</i><a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c015'><sup>[1043]</sup></a>. This Step he took to oblige the <i>Eustathians</i>, when he found
that they could by no means be induced to acknowlege <i>Meletius</i>.
But, instead of closing, he thereby widened, the Breach, the <i>Meletians</i>
declaring, that they would never abandon a Bishop of their own Party,
to acknowlege one of another, chosen without their Consent, or
even their Knowlege<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c015'><sup>[1044]</sup></a>. This unhappy Division, thus settled and confirmed
between the Two Orthodox Parties in <i>Antioch</i>, did not continue
long confined to that particular Church, but soon extended to
the Church universal; some owning <i>Meletius</i> for lawful Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>,
and others <i>Paulinus</i>. <i>Athanasius</i> communicated with <i>Paulinus</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and not with <i>Meletius</i>; and his Example was followed by the
Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, of <i>Cyprus</i>, and all the Bishops in the West<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c015'><sup>[1045]</sup></a>. On
the other hand, all the Orthodox Bishops in the East, except <i>Athanasius</i>,
and those I have mentioned, espoused, with great Warmth, the
Cause of <i>Meletius</i><a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c015'><sup>[1046]</sup></a>. They all continued, however, notwithstanding
this Disagreement, to communicate with each other, though with
some Indifference and Coldness. The Ordination of <i>Paulinus</i> gave
Rise to another Schism; for <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Vercelli</i>, finding, on his Arrival
at <i>Antioch</i>, all Hopes of an Accommodation cut off, and no
room left for the Measures concerted and agreed to by the Council,
immediately quitted the City, without communicating with either
Party. This was condemning the Conduct of <i>Lucifer</i>; which he
could not brook; and therefore, full of Resentment, he renounced
the Communion of <i>Eusebius</i>, with whom he had hitherto lived in
the greatest Intimacy, and suffered together with him a most painful
Exile for the common Cause<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c015'><sup>[1047]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>St.</i> Basil <i>Bishop of</i><br/>Cæsarea <i>applies to</i><br/>Damasus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Basil</i> Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i> in <i>Cappadocia</i>, one of the great Lights
of the Church, left nothing unattempted, which he apprehended
could any-ways contribute to the reuniting of the Orthodox among
themselves, and putting an End to the present Schism. But, despairing
at last of Success, and finding the Prelates in the East all warmly
engaged in the Dispute, some in favour of <i>Meletius</i>, and some of
<i>Paulinus</i>, he resolved to apply to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who had not
yet declared for either of the Competitors, his Thoughts being wholly
employed in securing his Dignity against a Competitor at Home. He
writ therefore to <i>Damasus</i>, intreating him to dispatch Deputies into
the East, who, in Concert with the Prelates there, inclined to an
Accommodation, might settle the proper Means of accomplishing so
desirable a Work, and uniting in Charity those, who were already
united in Faith. He added, that it was from his Zeal alone they expected
Relief, from that Zeal which he had made so eminently appear
on other Occasions; that <i>Dionysius</i>, one of his Predecessors,
had afforded them a seasonable Assistance, when their Wants were less
pressing, and their Condition not so deplorable; and therefore that
there was no room left to doubt of his readily conforming to so
glorious an Example<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c015'><sup>[1048]</sup></a>. With this Letter, and another from the Bishops
in the East, soliciting the Advice, Assistance, and Mediation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>their Collegues in the West, <i>Dorotheus</i>, Deacon of the Church of
<i>Antioch</i>, was dispatched into <i>Italy</i>: whence he returned in the Beginning
of the following Year 372. with an Answer from the Bishops
of <i>Illyricum</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and <i>Gaul</i><a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c015'><sup>[1049]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The haughty Conduct<br/>of</i> Damasus <i>resented<br/>by St.</i> Basil.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Damasus</i> did not condescend
to return an Answer to <i>Basil</i>, or take the least Notice of his Letter;
which haughty Conduct he justly resented, and in pretty sharp Terms,
taxing <i>Damasus</i>, in one of his Letters<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c015'><sup>[1050]</sup></a>, with a Spirit of Pride and
Vanity, which made him overlook other Bishops as below his Attention,
and expect to be accosted by them with the meanest Flattery.
But his thus disregarding the Request and Intreaties of the Bishop of
<i>Cæsarea</i>, was not owing to his Pride alone. He was so little acquainted
with the State of the Churches in the East, and what passed
there, that he looked upon <i>Eusebius</i> Bishop of <i>Samosata</i>, and <i>Meletius</i>,
with whom <i>Basil</i> lived in great Intimacy, as rank <i>Arians</i>, tho’
they both lived at that very time in Exile, having been driven from
their Sees by the <i>Arians</i>, on account of the Zeal, which they had,
with an invincible Firmness, exerted in Defence of the Orthodox
Faith<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c015'><sup>[1051]</sup></a>. The Bishop of <i>Rome</i> might, with very little Trouble, have
been better informed; but his Mind, it seems, was so deeply engaged
in worldly Affairs, and his Thoughts so taken up with State, Pomp,
and Grandeur, that he was never at Leisure to mind those Matters,
which justly claimed, and ought to have engrossed, his whole Attention.
By him the Western Bishops were led into the same Mistake
concerning <i>Eusebius</i> and <i>Meletius</i>; and hence the Backwardness they
shewed to correspond with <i>Basil</i>, as if he designed to impose upon
them, or was himself imposed upon by others. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St.</i> Basil <i>complains of</i><br/>Damasus, <i>and the<br/>Western Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Of this <i>Basil</i> justly
complained in a Letter he writ to <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Samosata</i>. <i>If the
Wrath of God</i>, says he, <i>is in the End appeased, if Mercy takes
place, what other Help do we stand in need of? But, if his Anger
continues, what Relief will the Pride of the West afford us? They
neither know the Truth, nor can they patiently bear it. They are
ever prepossessed with idle Jealousies, ever swayed by groundless Surmises;
and therefore act now the same Part they lately acted in the
Case of</i> Marcellinus; <i>that is, they quarrel with those, who inform
them of the Truth, and, being left to themselves, they introduce and
establish Heresies. As for my own Part, I had once some Thoughts
of writing a private Letter to their Chief</i> (that is, to <i>Damasus</i>), <i>and,
waving all Mention of Church Affairs, only tell him, that they</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span><i>neither know what passes here, nor take the right Method to be informed;
and that they ought not to oppress those who are already
humbled by Affliction, nor mistake Pride for Dignity, since that Sin
alone is capable of Setting a Man at Enmity with God</i><a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c015'><sup>[1052]</sup></a>. From these
Words it is pretty plain, that the Notion of the Pope’s Infallibility was
not yet broached, or at least was not yet known to <i>Basil</i>. The Bishop
of the Metropolis of the Empire was deservedly looked upon, in regard
of the Dignity of his See, as the Chief and Head of all the Western
Bishops; and to him as such, not as an infallible and unerring Judge,
the Eastern Bishops frequently applied in the Disputes, that happened
to rise among them; so that all we can infer from their applying to
him is, that his Authority bore a great Sway; which was owing to
the Pre-eminence of his See, and not to any Power or Prerogative
peculiar to him, and superior to others.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Damasus <i>takes on him<br/>the Office of Judge,<br/>being only chosen<br/>Mediator</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was long ere <i>Damasus</i> could be brought to give any Attention
to the Affairs of the East; and when he did, it was only to add
Fewel to the Fire, which had lately begun to rage with great Violence.
For, looking upon the Office of a bare Mediator, which alone
had been offered him, as no-ways suitable to his Dignity, he arrogantly
assumed that of a Judge, and not only acknowleged <i>Paulinus</i>
for lawful Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, but, misled by false and groundless Reports,
declared <i>Meletius</i> a Transgressor of the Canons, an Intruder, a
Schismatic, and even an Heretic<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c015'><sup>[1053]</sup></a>; that <i>Meletius</i>, who had suffered
Exile, and innumerable Hardships, in Defence of the Orthodox Faith,
who was then revered all over the East, as a Man of extraordinary
Sanctity, and is now honoured by the Church of <i>Rome</i> as a Saint of
the first Class. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Conduct con-<br/>demned by St.</i> Basil.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But his thus openly declaring in favour of <i>Paulinus</i>,
his treating in such a base and unworthy manner one of the most
eminent Prelates in the East, served only to engage the Followers of
<i>Meletius</i> more warmly in his Cause; and the great <i>Basil</i>, among the
rest, who could not help censuring the Conduct of <i>Damasus</i> as rash,
partial, and injudicious: he even repented his having ever applied to
him; for, in one of his Letters to <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Samosata</i>, he expresses
himself thus: <i>The Saying of</i> Diomedes <i>occurs to my Mind</i>; Intreaties
are not to be used with <i>Achilles</i>, he is too haughty<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c015'><sup>[1054]</sup></a>; <i>and
truly the more you flatter haughty and insolent Men, the more
haughty and insolent they become</i><a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c015'><sup>[1055]</sup></a>. As no Regard was had to the

Example, acknowleged <i>Paulinus</i>, and not <i>Meletius</i>, the Orthodox
Bishops in the East not only continued divided among themselves, but
a new Division arose between the Western Bishops, and those of the
Party of <i>Meletius</i>, at the Head of which was <i>Basil</i> Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i>.
But, of these unhappy Divisions, so far as the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> were
concerned in them, we shall have Occasion to speak hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New Disturbances<br/>raised in</i> Rome, <i>by<br/>the Partisans of</i><br/>Ursinus;</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Damasus</i> was far more successful in suppressing the Schism of <i>Ursinus</i>,
which about this time was revived at <i>Rome</i>. The Emperor
<i>Valentinian</i>, some time before, by a Rescript addressed to <i>Ampelius</i>
Governor, and <i>Maximinus</i> Vicar of <i>Rome</i>, had allowed <i>Ursinus</i>, and
the leading Men of his Party, who had been confined with him to
<i>Gaul</i>, Liberty to live where they pleased, provided they kept out of
<i>Rome</i>, and the Suburbicarian Provinces<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c015'><sup>[1056]</sup></a>. This Indulgence shewn
by the Emperor to <i>Ursinus</i>, encouraged his Followers in <i>Rome</i> to
declare openly in his Favour, and even to assemble apart from those
who communicated with <i>Damasus</i>. But, being therein opposed by
the Party of <i>Damasus</i> with their usual Violence, new Disturbances
arose, and the City was upon the point of becoming again the Scene
of a Civil War. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who are banished.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Simplicius</i>, then Vicar of <i>Rome</i>, at the Request of
<i>Damasus</i>, gave the Emperor immediate Notice of the approaching
Danger; and the Emperor, in Answer to his Letter, sent him a Rescript,
commanding <i>all those who, in Contempt of Religion, held or
frequented unlawful Assemblies, to be banished an Hundred Miles
from</i> Rome, <i>that their Obstinacy might hurt none but themselves</i><a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c015'><sup>[1057]</sup></a>.
Thus for the present a Stop was put to the Disorders that had begun to
reign in the City.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Luciferians<i> per-<br/>secuted by</i> Damasus.</div>

<p class='c001'>The two Presbyters <i>Marcellinus</i> and <i>Faustinus</i> pretend, that this
Law was levelled at the <i>Ursinians</i> alone, but was interpreted by <i>Damasus</i>,
as comprehending the <i>Luciferians</i>, or the Followers of <i>Lucifer</i>
Bishop of <i>Cagliari</i>, who, refusing to communicate with the Bishops
who signed the Confession of <i>Rimini</i>, and with all who communicated
with them, had separate Assemblies at <i>Rome</i>, and even a
Bishop of their own, named <i>Aurelius</i>. But <i>Damasus</i>, say they, using
them, in virtue of the above-mentioned Law, with no less Cruelty
than he did the <i>Ursinians</i>, they thenceforth assembled only in the
Night, under a Presbyter, named <i>Macarius</i>, of whose Sanity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Austerities they relate wonderful Things. But Night and Darkness
could not protect them against the persecuting Spirit of <i>Damasus</i>,
whose Clerks, breaking one Night in upon them, while they were
performing Divine Service in a private House, dispersed the Congregation,
seized <i>Macarius</i>, and dragging him along with them over the
sharp Flints, by which he was cruelly bruised, and dangerously wounded
in the Thigh, they kept him the remaining Part of the Night closely
confined. Next Morning he was carried before the Judge, who,
finding him inflexible in rejecting the Communion of <i>Damasus</i>, condemned
him to Exile; but the holy Presbyter, being arrived at <i>Ostia</i>,
died there of his Wounds<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c015'><sup>[1058]</sup></a>. The same Authors add, that <i>Damasus</i>
caused several Catholic Presbyters to be sent into Exile, and some
Laymen; but that <i>Aurelius</i>, the <i>Luciferian</i> Bishop, in spite of all his
Efforts, continued in <i>Rome</i> to the Hour of his Death<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c015'><sup>[1059]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Apollinaris <i>the<br/>Heresiarch. An<br/>Account of him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>About this Time, that is, in the Year 377. a great Council was held
at <i>Rome</i>, in which the famous <i>Apollinaris</i>, Bishop of <i>Laodicea</i> in
<i>Syria</i>, was condemned and deposed with his Two Disciples <i>Vitalis</i> and
<i>Timotheus</i>. <i>Apollinaris</i> was a Man of uncommon Parts, great Penetration,
universal Knowlege; and had at first been so zealous a Defender
of the Orthodox Faith, that he was looked upon by all, particularly
by <i>Epiphanius</i> and <i>Athanasius</i>, as one of the great Champions
of that Cause<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c015'><sup>[1060]</sup></a>, and ranked by <i>Philostorgius</i> with <i>Basil</i>, and <i>Gregory
Nazianzen</i><a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c015'><sup>[1061]</sup></a>. He contracted a strict Friendship with <i>Athanasius</i>,
when that Prelate passed through <i>Laodicea</i> in 349. on his Return to
<i>Egypt</i>, and ever after maintained a close Correspondence with him,
on which Account he was excommunicated by <i>Gregory</i> the <i>Arian</i>
Bishop of that City<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c015'><sup>[1062]</sup></a>. When the <i>Arians</i> began to prevail in the East,
<i>Apollinaris</i> was cruelly persecuted by the Men in Power of that Party,
and at last driven into Exile<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c015'><sup>[1063]</sup></a>. <i>Basil</i> writ several Letters to him,
and in those he writ to others, often mentions him as a Person for
whom he had the greatest Esteem<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c015'><sup>[1064]</sup></a>. He is said to have excelled in the
Knowlege of the Scriptures, which he publicly interpreted at <i>Antioch</i>,
where he had <i>Jerom</i> among the many Disciples, who flocked from all
Parts to hear him<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c015'><sup>[1065]</sup></a>. But he was equally versed in human Learning, especially
in Poetry; and his Knowlege in that Branch of Literature proved
very useful in the Time of the Emperor <i>Julian</i>. For that Prince having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>by a Law debarred the Christians from perusing or studying the Pagan
Authors, <i>Apollinaris</i>, to supply the want of those Writers, composed
several Pieces in Imitation of them, and, among the rest, a Poem
comprising the History of the <i>Jews</i> to the Time of <i>Saul</i>, and divided
into Twenty-four Books, which he distinguished by so many Letters of
the <i>Greek</i> Alphabet, as <i>Homer</i> had done<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c015'><sup>[1066]</sup></a>. He likewise writ Comedies,
Tragedies, Lyric Verses, <i>&amp;c.</i> imitating <i>Pindar</i> in the latter,
and <i>Menander</i> and <i>Euripides</i> in the Two former<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c015'><sup>[1067]</sup></a>. <i>Sozomen</i> thinks
his Compositions fell in no respect short of the Works of the Antients;
who, upon the Whole, says he, were far inferior to him, since they
excelled, each in one Kind only, but he equally in all<a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c015'><sup>[1068]</sup></a>. The Tragedy,
intituled, <i>Christ suffering</i>, which is to be found among the
Works of <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, is by some ascribed to <i>Apollinaris</i>;
but that Piece does not at all answer the great Opinion <i>Sozomen</i> seems
to have entertained of him. His Paraphrase in Hexameter Verse on
the Psalms, the only intire Work of his that has reached our Times, is
an elegant, exact, and sublime Translation of them, greatly commended
and admired by the best Judges<a id='r1069' /><a href='#f1069' class='c015'><sup>[1069]</sup></a>. His Poetry proved very
serviceable to him, when he began to broach his Heresy; for great
Numbers of People, especially Women, embraced his Doctrine, being
taken, and in a manner inchanted, with the Sweetness of his
Verses; for he composed a great many Songs and Odes equally pious
and elegant, adapted to all Occasions, and on all Occasions sung with
suitable Airs by his Followers<a id='r1070' /><a href='#f1070' class='c015'><sup>[1070]</sup></a>. To these <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> no
doubt alludes, where he speaks of the Psalms of the <i>Apollinarists</i>, to
which the Psalms of <i>David</i> had given place; of those sweet and so
much admired Verses, which were looked upon by them as a Third
Testament<a id='r1071' /><a href='#f1071' class='c015'><sup>[1071]</sup></a>. It was chiefly to oppose the Progress <i>Apollinaris</i> made,
by the insinuating Means of his Poetry, that <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>
applied himself to the same Study. About the Year 362. <i>Apollinaris</i>
was raised, in Consideration of his great Piety and Learning, to the
See of <i>Laodicea</i> in <i>Syria</i>, in which City he was born, according to
the most probable Opinion, and had spent the greater Part of his
Life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Doctrine held by</i><br/>Apollinaris, <i>and his<br/>Disciples</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Doctrine held by <i>Apollinaris</i>, and his Followers, called
from him <i>Apollinarists</i>; they maintained at first, that <i>Christ</i> had human
Flesh, but not a human Soul, the Want of which was supplied,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>according to them, by the Divinity. But being afterwards convinced,
that such a Doctrine was repugnant to several plain and express Passages
of Scripture, they abandoned it in Part, and, distinguishing, with
some Philosophers, the Soul, by which we live, from the Intelligence,
by which we reason, they allowed the former in our <i>Saviour</i>,
but denied the latter; the Operations of which, said they, were performed
by the Divinity<a id='r1072' /><a href='#f1072' class='c015'><sup>[1072]</sup></a>. Thus they allowed him, says St. <i>Austin</i>,
the Soul of a Beast, but denied him that of a Man<a id='r1073' /><a href='#f1073' class='c015'><sup>[1073]</sup></a>. By means of
this Doctrine they avoided the Absurdity with which they reproached
the Catholics, admitting in Christ, as they falsly imagined, Two opposite
and distinct Natures, without any Union or Subordination between
them<a id='r1074' /><a href='#f1074' class='c015'><sup>[1074]</sup></a>. The Catholics indeed acknowleged Two distinct and
complete Natures in Christ; but at the same time maintained an Union
between them, such an Union as was admitted by the <i>Apollinarists</i>
between the Flesh and the Divinity. The latter upbraided the Catholics
with adoring a Man, styling them <i>Anthropolaters</i>; and the Catholics
reproached in their Turn the <i>Apollinarists</i> with adoring the
Flesh, calling them <i>Sarcolaters</i><a id='r1075' /><a href='#f1075' class='c015'><sup>[1075]</sup></a>. The <i>Apollinarists</i> distinguished
themselves from the Catholics, by causing the following Words to
be fixed on the Front of their Houses; <i>We must not adore a Man that
bears a God, but a God that bears Flesh</i>. The Errors of the <i>Apollinarists</i>
were not only concerning the Soul, but likewise the Body of our
Saviour; for they maintained, that his Body, like other Bodies only
in Appearance, was coeval with the Divinity, and of the same Substance
with the eternal Wisdom<a id='r1076' /><a href='#f1076' class='c015'><sup>[1076]</sup></a>. Hence it followed, by a natural
Consequence, that the Body of our Saviour was impassible and immortal;
that it was not taken of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>; that he was not
born of her; that his Birth, Passion, Death, and Resurrection, were
mere Illusions; or else, that the Divine Nature was passible: both
which Absurdities were admitted by some of the Sects into which the
<i>Apollinarists</i> were afterwards divided<a id='r1077' /><a href='#f1077' class='c015'><sup>[1077]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Apollinaris <i>not known<br/>nor suspected to be<br/>the Author of the<br/>Heresy he broached</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>This Doctrine was first heard of in 362. and condemned the same
Year in the Council of <i>Alexandria</i>. In 373. it began to make a great
Noise in the Church; but it was not known even then by whom it
had been broached: for <i>Apollinaris</i> was so far from owning himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the Author of those Tenets, that, in one of his Letters to <i>Serapion</i>
Bishop of <i>Thmuis</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, which is still extant<a id='r1078' /><a href='#f1078' class='c015'><sup>[1078]</sup></a>, he expresses, in
the strongest Terms, his Approbation of a Letter from <i>Athanasius</i> to
<i>Epictetus</i> Bishop of <i>Corinth</i>, confuting the very Errors he held; and
at the same time condemns the Folly of those, who maintained the
Flesh to be consubstantial to the Divine Nature. In another Letter to
the same <i>Serapion</i>, he owns the Body of our Saviour to have been taken
of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, to have been formed in her Womb, and his
Flesh to have been of the same Substance with ours; adding, <i>And these
are Truths not to be called in question</i><a id='r1079' /><a href='#f1079' class='c015'><sup>[1079]</sup></a>. In a Third Letter he assures
<i>Serapion</i>, that he has ever denied in his Writings the Flesh of our Saviour
to have descended from Heaven, or to be of the same Substance
with the Divinity<a id='r1080' /><a href='#f1080' class='c015'><sup>[1080]</sup></a>. <i>Apollinaris</i>, by thus publicly declaring against
the Doctrine, which at the same time he was privately propagating,
eluded the Vigilance of <i>Athanasius</i> himself, who, in confuting his
Errors, never mentions his Name, nor seems to have entertained the
least Suspicion of him; nay, he recommended <i>Timotheus</i>, a favourite
Disciple of his, to <i>Damasus</i>, as a Person whose Orthodoxy was
not to be questioned; and as such he was received, not only by the
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, but by all the Western Bishops, of whom he obtained
Letters, on his Return, directed to <i>Apollinaris</i>, as to a Bishop
of the Catholic Communion<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c015'><sup>[1081]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Errors con-<br/>demned in a Council<br/>at</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Year 374. or 375. <i>Damasus</i> convened a great Council at
<i>Rome</i>, in which the Errors of <i>Apollinaris</i> were condemned; but neither
was he nor any other named as the Broacher or Author of that
Doctrine. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Damasus <i>imposed<br/>upon by</i> Vitalis <i>one<br/>of his Disciples</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The very Year that <i>Damasus</i> condemned the Doctrine of
<i>Apollinaris</i>, he was deceived and over-reached by one of the Disciples
of that Heresiarch, named <i>Vitalis</i>. He was a Presbyter of the Church
of <i>Antioch</i>, and of the Communion of <i>Meletius</i>, by whom he had
been ordained; but afterwards, renouncing his Communion, he joined
<i>Apollinaris</i>, and, being in high Esteem with the People, drew great
Numbers over with him to that Side. Of these, called from him
<i>Vitalians</i>, <i>Apollinaris</i> some Years after appointed him Bishop, adding
thereby a Fourth Party to the Three that already divided the Church
of <i>Antioch</i>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Arians</i>, <i>Paulinians</i>, and <i>Meletians</i><a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c015'><sup>[1082]</sup></a>. Before
he threw off the Mask, and publicly maintained the Tenets of <i>Apollinaris</i>,
he strove to be admitted with his Followers to the Communion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of <i>Paulinus</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, and of <i>Damasus</i>; and with this
View he undertook a Journey to <i>Rome</i> in the Year 375. As he had
been suspected, and even accused, of holding the Doctrine of <i>Apollinaris</i>,
<i>Damasus</i> required of him, before he admitted him to his Communion,
a Confession of his Faith, which he gave under his Hand,
but in such Terms as bore a double Meaning. <i>Damasus</i>, however,
well satisfied with it, gave him a Letter for <i>Paulinus</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, and
sent him back to be admitted by that Bishop to the Communion of
the Church<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c015'><sup>[1083]</sup></a>. But <i>Damasus</i> soon after, either upon his own Reflection,
or at the Suggestion of others, apprehending himself imposed
upon, writ another Letter to <i>Paulinus</i>, by the Presbyter <i>Petronius</i>,
and afterwards a Third, which <i>Holstenius</i> has inserted at Length in
his <i>Roman Collection</i><a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c015'><sup>[1084]</sup></a>. Together with this Letter <i>Damasus</i> sent to
<i>Paulinus</i> a Confession of Faith, drawn up by a Council summoned
for that Purpose, desiring him to admit none to his Communion,
but such as should sign that Confession, and the Confession of <i>Nice</i><a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c015'><sup>[1085]</sup></a>.
To this Piece the Fathers of the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i> no doubt allude,
in commending <i>Damasus</i> for pointing out, in his Letters to <i>Paulinus</i>,
the Rules all Catholics ought to be guided by in reasoning of
the Mystery of the Incarnation<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c015'><sup>[1086]</sup></a>. What <i>Baronius</i> observes here is true,
<i>viz.</i> that <i>Vitalis</i>, by the same ambiguous Confession of Faith, imposed
upon <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, who received the <i>Apollinarists</i> as
Brethren, and not as Enemies<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c015'><sup>[1087]</sup></a>. He adds, <i>And no Wonder that</i> Vitalis
<i>imposed upon</i> Damasus, <i>since by the same Confession he imposed
upon</i> Gregory Nazianzen: he ought rather to have said, <i>No Wonder
that he imposed upon</i> Gregory, <i>who did not pretend to Infallibility,
since he imposed upon</i> Damasus, <i>who was infallible</i>. As <i>Vitalis</i> refused
to sign the Confession sent by <i>Damasus</i>, <i>Paulinus</i> would not
admit him to his Communion; upon which he pulled off the Mask,
publicly renounced the Communion both of <i>Damasus</i> and <i>Paulinus</i>,
and, bidding Defiance to the Canons, accepted the Title and Dignity
of Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, offered him by <i>Apollinaris</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Apollinaris <i>openly de-<br/>clares against the<br/>Church.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At the same time
that Heresiarch, finding he could conceal himself no longer, openly
declared, that he would communicate with none who held, that our
Saviour had taken a human Soul, and human Understanding: which
was separating himself from the Communion of the Catholic Church<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c015'><sup>[1088]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>It was long before it was believed in the Church that those Tenets had
been broached, or were held, by <i>Apollinaris</i>: no Credit was given,
at first, even to his Disciples, most People being inclined to think, that
they were mistaken, and did not comprehend the sublime Thoughts
of that great Man<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c015'><sup>[1089]</sup></a>. But when no room was left for any further
Doubt, the Surprize and Concern of the whole Catholic Party were
equal to the high Opinion they had entertained of him till that Time<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c015'><sup>[1090]</sup></a>.
When <i>Epiphanius</i> writ against the <i>Apollinarists</i>, he well knew <i>Apollinaris</i>
to be the Author of that Sect; for he reproaches him with
this unwarrantable Separation from the Church; and yet he speaks of
him with the greatest Respect; seems to think, that many Things
had been unjustly fathered upon him; and takes a great deal of Pains
to assure his Reader, that what he writes is Truth, and not Calumny
proceeding from any private Pique, Malice, or Grudge<a id='r1091' /><a href='#f1091' class='c015'><sup>[1091]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A great Schism in the<br/>Church.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Schism, which the establishing of a new Bishop occasioned in
the Church of <i>Antioch</i>, was not confined to that alone, but extended
to most other Churches, over which <i>Apollinaris</i> appointed Bishops
of his own Sect, who held separate Assemblies, practised different Rites,
and, instead of the sacred Hymns commonly sung at Divine Service
by the rest of the Church, introduced Canticles composed by their
Leader, and containing the Substance of his Doctrine<a id='r1092' /><a href='#f1092' class='c015'><sup>[1092]</sup></a>. The many
perplexed Questions and Difficulties, which he and his Emissaries were
daily starting about the Incarnation, bred such Confusion in the Minds
of Men, that many began to question the Truth of that Mystery<a id='r1093' /><a href='#f1093' class='c015'><sup>[1093]</sup></a>.
The Objections they moved against our Saviour’s taking Flesh, and
being born of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, seemed calculated merely to raise
improper Ideas, and sully the Thoughts of chaste Minds; for they
themselves held his Body to be coeval with the Divinity, and to have
only been conveyed into the World by means of the Virgin <i>Mary</i><a id='r1094' /><a href='#f1094' class='c015'><sup>[1094]</sup></a>.
Their Doctrine was applauded and received by many, and few who
read their Books were content with, or kept to the plain and antient
Doctrine of the Church<a id='r1095' /><a href='#f1095' class='c015'><sup>[1095]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Basil <i>recurs to the<br/>Western Bishops</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Basil</i> therefore, and the other orthodox
Bishops in the East, to put a Stop the more effectually to the growing
Evil, not only declaimed against it in all their Writings, but dispatched
the Two Presbyters <i>Dorotheus</i> and <i>Sanctissimus</i> with Letters to <i>Damasus</i>,
and the other Western Bishops, intreating them to condemn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>without Delay the Doctrine of <i>Apollinaris</i>, and <i>Apollinaris</i> himself,
since he had at last openly declared against the Church, and owned
himself the Author of the new Sect<a id='r1096' /><a href='#f1096' class='c015'><sup>[1096]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who condemn the<br/>Doctrine of</i> Apol-<br/>linaris, <i>and depose<br/>him with</i> Vitelis<br/><i>and</i> Timotheus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In Compliance with this Request,
a great Council was convened at <i>Rome</i> the following Year 378.
in which <i>Apollinaris</i> was not only condemned with great Solemnity,
but deposed, with his Two favourite Disciples, <i>Vitalis</i> and <i>Timotheus</i>;
the former Bishop of the <i>Apollinarists</i> at <i>Antioch</i>, and the
latter at <i>Berytus</i> in <i>Ph&oelig;nicia</i><a id='r1097' /><a href='#f1097' class='c015'><sup>[1097]</sup></a>. By the same Council it was defined,
that <i>Jesus</i> was true Man, and true God; and whoever maintained
or asserted any thing to be wanting either to his Humanity or Divinity,
was declared an Enemy to the Church<a id='r1098' /><a href='#f1098' class='c015'><sup>[1098]</sup></a>. <i>Vitalis</i> had deceived <i>Damasus</i>,
as I have observed above, by a Confession of Faith, in which,
under equivocal Terms, he had artfully concealed his Heresy. The
Bishop of <i>Rome</i> therefore, now undeceived, caused the Confession he
had formerly approved of to be anathematized by the Council, together
with its Author, exerting himself, says <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, with
so much the more Vigour against them, as they had formerly taken
Advantage of his Candour and Sincerity to impose upon him<a id='r1099' /><a href='#f1099' class='c015'><sup>[1099]</sup></a>.
<i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> therefore supposes, that the Pope could be imposed
upon in a Matter concerning the Faith. Indeed the Sticklers
for Infallibility must either give up that Prerogative, or allow all the
Fathers to have talked Nonsense.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Mistake of</i> Baronius.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i> is certainly mistaken, and so was <i>Ruffinus</i><a id='r1100' /><a href='#f1100' class='c015'><sup>[1100]</sup></a>, whom he
follows, in asserting the Heresy of <i>Apollinaris</i> to have been first condemned
by the Council of <i>Rome</i>, since it is manifest, that the Doctrine
of that Heresiarch had been condemned long before by <i>Athanasius</i>,
<i>Basil</i>, and <i>Epiphanius</i>, in their Writings, and by the Council held at
<i>Alexandria</i> in 362. But <i>Ruffinus</i> probably meant no more, than that
those Errors were first condemned by the Council of <i>Rome</i>, under the
Name, and together with the Person, of <i>Apollinaris</i>; which is undeniable.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Another Mistake of<br/>the same Writer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  I cannot help observing here another Mistake of <i>Baronius</i>,
pretending that <i>Damasus</i> (for whatever was done by the Council is
by him ascribed to <i>Damasus</i> alone) in condemning <i>Apollinaris</i> condemned
all the Errors he held; and consequently the Opinion of the
<i>Millenarians</i>, holding that <i>Christ</i> was to return upon the Earth, and
reign over the Faithful a Thousand Years before the End of the World.

of <i>Hierapolis</i>, a Man of great Piety,  honoured by the Church
of <i>Rome</i> as a Saint<a id='r1101' /><a href='#f1101' class='c015'><sup>[1101]</sup></a>. He declares, in the few Fragments of his
Works, which have been conveyed to us by <i>Eusebius</i><a id='r1102' /><a href='#f1102' class='c015'><sup>[1102]</sup></a>, that, as he
lived near the Times of the Apostles, he made it his chief Business to
learn of their Disciples whatever they could recollect to have been
done or said by them, on different Occasions, that was not recorded
in Holy Writ. Thus he learned the above-mentioned Doctrine<a id='r1103' /><a href='#f1103' class='c015'><sup>[1103]</sup></a>,
which, upon the Authority of such a Tradition, countenanced by
some Passages in the <i>Revelations</i><a id='r1104' /><a href='#f1104' class='c015'><sup>[1104]</sup></a>, and one Text in St. <i>Paul</i>, was
embraced and held by the most eminent Men for Piety and Learning,
at that time, in the Church; and, among the rest, by <i>Irenæus</i>,
and <i>Justin</i> the Martyr. And yet such a Doctrine is now rank Heresy
in the Church of <i>Rome</i>. But, by declaring it such, have they not
overset their own System, which places Tradition upon a Level with
the Canonical Books of the Scripture? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How little Tradition to<br/>be depended upon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Can they allege a more antient
Tradition, one more universally received, or equally countenanced
by Scripture, in favour of the many traditional Articles
of Faith, which they have obtruded upon the World? <i>Papias</i> declares,
he received the above-mentioned Doctrine of those who had
learned it immediately of the Apostles. If such a Tradition be rejected
as false, what other has a Right to be admitted as true? If we
deny or question St. <i>Peter</i>’s having been at <i>Rome</i>, Tradition, and
the Authority of <i>Irenæus</i> (for all the others have copied from him),
are immediately produced against us. But what Weight either ought
to bear, the Case before us sufficiently demonstrates.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return to <i>Apollinaris</i>: It is very certain, that he held and
taught the Doctrine of the <i>Millenarians</i>; but it is no less certain,
that such a Doctrine was not condemned, as <i>Baronius</i> pretends<a id='r1105' /><a href='#f1105' class='c015'><sup>[1105]</sup></a>, by
the Council of <i>Rome</i> in 378. since many eminent Men in the Church
held it, and <i>Sulpitius Severus</i> among the rest, after that Council, without
being deemed Heretics on that score. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Apollinarists <i>con-<br/>demned by several<br/>Councils</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Sentence pronounced
against <i>Apollinaris</i>, and his Disciples, by the Council of <i>Rome</i>, was
confirmed by a Council held the same Year at <i>Alexandria</i><a id='r1106' /><a href='#f1106' class='c015'><sup>[1106]</sup></a>, by an
Oecumenical Council assembled at <i>Constantinople</i> in 381. and by the
Council of <i>Antioch</i> in 379<a id='r1107' /><a href='#f1107' class='c015'><sup>[1107]</sup></a>. However, the <i>Apollinarists</i>, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>thus condemned and deposed by all the Councils of the East and
West, as we read in <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i><a id='r1108' /><a href='#f1108' class='c015'><sup>[1108]</sup></a>, still kept their Ground,
till Recourse was had to the Secular Power. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Penal Laws enacted<br/>against them.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>,
at the Request of <i>Nectarius</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, enacted
a Law, dated the Tenth of <i>March</i> 388. forbidding the <i>Apollinarists</i>
to hold Assemblies, to have any Ecclesiastics or Bishops, or to dwell
in the Cities<a id='r1109' /><a href='#f1109' class='c015'><sup>[1109]</sup></a>. As this Law was executed with the utmost Rigour,
at least against the leading Men of the Party, who were banished the
Cities, and confined to the Deserts<a id='r1110' /><a href='#f1110' class='c015'><sup>[1110]</sup></a>, the <i>Apollinarists</i> were in a few
Years reduced to a very small Number, when they begged to be admitted
to the Communion of the Catholic Church, which was in
the End granted them by <i>Theodotus</i><a id='r1111' /><a href='#f1111' class='c015'><sup>[1111]</sup></a>, who governed the Church of
<i>Antioch</i>, from the Year 416. to 428. But as their Conversion was
owing not to Conviction, but Persecution, they still held in their
Hearts the same Sentiments, which ever must happen in the like Case;
nay, and privately instilled their Errors into the Minds of many, whose
Faith had been, till that time, untainted<a id='r1112' /><a href='#f1112' class='c015'><sup>[1112]</sup></a>. It was to these pretended
Catholics, or disguised <i>Apollinarists</i>, that the <i>Eutychian</i> Heresy, and
that of the <i>Monothelites</i>, of whom I shall speak hereafter, owed their
Birth<a id='r1113' /><a href='#f1113' class='c015'><sup>[1113]</sup></a>. Hence the Emperor <i>Marcian</i>, by an Edict in 455. declared
the <i>Eutychians</i> to be <i>Apollinarists</i>, and consequently liable to the
same Penalties<a id='r1114' /><a href='#f1114' class='c015'><sup>[1114]</sup></a>. As for <i>Apollinaris</i> himself, he died about the Year
392. having maintained, to the Hour of his Death, the same Sentiments,
in which he had lived; and, with them, the same outward
Appearance, at least, of a most holy and exemplary Life<a id='r1115' /><a href='#f1115' class='c015'><sup>[1115]</sup></a>; which is all
the Authors of those Times Will allow him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New Disturbances<br/>raised by</i> Ursinus.</div>

<p class='c001'>While <i>Damasus</i>, and the other Western Bishops, were wholly intent
upon suppressing the Heresy of <i>Apollinaris</i>, and restoring the
Eastern Churches to their former Tranquillity, the Antipope <i>Ursinus</i>,
laying hold of that Opportunity, arrived privately at <i>Milan</i>, and there
joined the <i>Arians</i>, upon their promising to support him with the
whole Power of their Party<a id='r1116' /><a href='#f1116' class='c015'><sup>[1116]</sup></a>. But <i>Ambrose</i>, who then governed that
Church, and kept a watchful Eye over the Flock committed to his
Care, gave immediate Notice of their clandestine Meetings, and pernicious
Designs, to the Emperor <i>Gratian</i>, who soon after ordered <i>Ursinus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to quit <i>Italy</i>, and confined him to <i>Cologne</i><a id='r1117' /><a href='#f1117' class='c015'><sup>[1117]</sup></a>. During his Exile
his Partisans were not idle; they found the Emperor <i>Gratian</i>, who
in 375. had succeeded his Father <i>Valentinian</i> I. warmly engaged in
favour of <i>Damasus</i>: they well knew, that so long as he continued
in that Disposition, it would be in vain to solicit the Return of
<i>Ursinus</i>, or to put up any Petition in his Behalf. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Damasus <i>falsly ac-<br/>cused, but cleared by<br/>the Emperor</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In order therefore to
estrange the Mind of the Emperor from <i>Damasus</i>, they suborned a
<i>Jew</i>, named <i>Isaac</i>, who had embraced the Christian Religion, but
was then returned to Judaism, to accuse him before the Civil Magistrate
of an heinous Crime, which I find not specified by any of the
Antients. But the Emperor, taking upon himself the judging of that
Cause, soon discovered the Innocence of the Accused, and the Malice
of the Accuser; and therefore, honourably acquitting the former,
and punishing the latter according to his Deserts, confined him to a
Corner of <i>Spain</i><a id='r1118' /><a href='#f1118' class='c015'><sup>[1118]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Attempt on the Reputation of <i>Damasus</i> was not the only
Thing that gave him great Uneasiness at this time. The Emperor
<i>Valentinian</i> had transferred, as I have related above, the Power of
judging Bishops, such at least as were concerned in the Schism of
<i>Ursinus</i>, from the Civil Magistrate to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some Bishops, de-<br/>posed by</i> Damasus,<br/><i>keep their Sees</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But several
Bishops, though deposed by him, still maintained themselves in
their Sees, with open Force, in Defiance of his Sentence, and the
Imperial Law. Among these were the Bishop of <i>Parma</i>, and <i>Florentius</i>
Bishop of <i>Puzzuolo</i>, who, for their Attachment to <i>Ursinus</i>,
had been both deposed by <i>Damasus</i>, and other Bishops assembled at
<i>Rome</i><a id='r1119' /><a href='#f1119' class='c015'><sup>[1119]</sup></a>. The <i>Donatists</i> too, notwithstanding the severe Laws enacted
against them by several Emperors, had got Footing in <i>Italy</i>,
and in <i>Rome</i> itself, where they were known by the Names of <i>Montenenses</i>,
and <i>Rupenses</i>, on account of their assembling in a Church
or Oratory, which they had among the neighbouring Rocks and
Mountains<a id='r1120' /><a href='#f1120' class='c015'><sup>[1120]</sup></a>. They had a Bishop of their own, either sent from
<i>Africa</i>, or ordained by Bishops sent from thence for that Purpose.
<i>Claudian</i>, who governed them at this time, was their Fifth Bishop of
<i>Rome</i><a id='r1121' /><a href='#f1121' class='c015'><sup>[1121]</sup></a>. The Emperor ordered him to be sent back to <i>Africa</i>,
whence he came. But though he had been several times imprisoned,
in order to oblige him by that means to return, he could not even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>so be prevailed upon to abandon his Flock; but continued at <i>Rome</i>,
perverting many there, and rebaptizing all he could pervert<a id='r1122' /><a href='#f1122' class='c015'><sup>[1122]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Italian <i>Bishops<br/>recur to the Emperor</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> To
put a Stop to these Evils, the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, assembling at <i>Rome</i>,
had recourse to the Emperor <i>Gratian</i>, acquainting him with the
Conduct of the contumacious Bishops, and earnestly intreating him
to cause the Law, commanding the Bishops to be judged by the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>, and not by the Civil Magistrate, which he himself had
enacted with his Father, to be put in Execution. By that Law, the
Emperor, in all Likelihood, only intended to confirm, with respect
to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, the Canons of the Church, appointing the
Metropolitan, with his Council, Judge of the Bishops of his Province
in Ecclesiastical Causes. But the Bishops, assembled on this Occasion
at <i>Rome</i>, attempted to extend the Authority of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>,
far beyond the Bounds to which the Emperors and Canons had confined
it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their letter to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For, in their Letter to <i>Gratian</i>, they suggested the following
Regulations as necessary for the Tranquillity of the Church, and
intreated him to establish them by Law: 1. That if any, who had
been condemned by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, or other Catholic Bishops,
should, after such Condemnation, presume to keep their Churches,
they should be banished from the Territories of the Cities, where
they had been Bishops. 2. That such as should refuse, when lawfully
summoned, to appear before the Bishops, should be obliged, by the
Prefect of <i>Italy</i>, or his Vicar, to repair to <i>Rome</i>, to be judged there.
3. That, if the accused Bishop resided in a distant Province, he should
be obliged, by the Judges of the Place, to appear before his Metropolitan;
and, if his Metropolitan was suspected as partial, or prejudiced
against him, he might be allowed to appeal to the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>, or to a Council of Fifteen neighbouring Bishops; but, if the
Accused was himself a Metropolitan, he should either repair to <i>Rome</i>,
or appear before such Judges as the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> should appoint;
and, when thus condemned, submit to the Sentence<a id='r1123' /><a href='#f1123' class='c015'><sup>[1123]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>What they demand in<br/>particular for the<br/>Bishop of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In Behalf
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> in particular they begged, in the same Letter,
that, as he <i>was above other Bishops by the Prerogative of the Apostolic
See, though upon a Level with them as to the Ministry</i>, he
might not be obliged to appear before the Civil Magistrate, since
other Bishops had been exempted from their Jurisdiction, but before
a Council, or that the Emperor would reserve to himself the Cognisance
of what concerned him, leaving to the ordinary Judges the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Power of examining Facts and Witnesses, but not the Authority of
pronouncing Sentence<a id='r1124' /><a href='#f1124' class='c015'><sup>[1124]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Emperor’s<br/>Answer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  What Answer the Emperor returned to the
Council, we know not; but, in a Rescript, addressed to the Vicar
<i>Aquilinus</i>, after summing up the Heads of the Letter from the
Council, and severely reprimanding his Officers for their Neglect, in
not causing the Imperial Law to be put in Execution, he confirms the
Rescript address’d to <i>Simplicius</i>, which I have mentioned above;
commands the Bishop of <i>Parma</i>, <i>Florentius</i> of <i>Puzzuolo</i>, and <i>Claudian</i>
the <i>Donatist</i>, with all those who shall be condemned by the
Councils, as Disturbers of the Quiet of the Church, to be driven from
their Dioceses, and banished an Hundred Miles from <i>Rome</i>: he grants
all the Council had desired, with respect to the judging of Bishops;
but requires the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> to act with the Advice of Five or
Seven other Bishops; and, lastly, he forbids Persons of infamous Characters,
or known Slanderers, to be admitted as Informers or Witnesses
against Bishops<a id='r1125' /><a href='#f1125' class='c015'><sup>[1125]</sup></a>. In this Rescript he takes no notice of what
the Council had asked for the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> in particular.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In what Sense the<br/>Pope above other<br/>Bishops.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>From these Pieces, which are still extant, it is manifest beyond all
Dispute, as the Reader must have observed, that, in the Year 378.
when this Council was held, no Prerogative was yet discovered in the
Pope, peculiar to him, and not common to all Bishops, besides that
of Rank, which arose from the Dignity of his See, that is, from his
being Bishop of the Metropolis of the Empire; for, in that respect
alone, the Bishops, who composed the Council, acknowleged him <i>to
be above them</i>; nay, by declaring themselves, in express Terms, <i>equal
to him as to the Ministry</i>, they seem to have taken particular Care,
that no Room or Pretence should be left for his claiming a Superiority
in any other respect. And how great would their Surprize have
been, had <i>Damasus</i>, in hearing that Part of their Address to the
Emperor, started up, and, protesting against it, as derogatory to his
Prerogative, declared, that, <i>to him all Power was given in Heaven
and on Earth</i>; that, <i>so far from being equal to him, they, and all
other Bishops, were but his Deputies and Delegates</i>; that <i>the Power,
Authority, and Jurisdiction, which they enjoyed, were derived to
them from the Plenitude of his</i>! Had he talked in this Strain, the
whole Council would have concluded him delirious. And yet these
are the Sentiments of his Successors; these the very Words, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>which they and their Divines have expressed them<a id='r1126' /><a href='#f1126' class='c015'><sup>[1126]</sup></a>; so that it is now
reckoned Heresy not to believe what in the Fourth Century it had
been deemed Madness to have gravely uttered. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Power he now<br/>claims unknown in the<br/>Time of</i> Damasus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It would perhaps
have seemed still more strange and surprising to the Fathers of the
Council, however prejudiced in his Favour, if <i>Damasus</i>, instead of
gratefully acknowleging their Regard for him in petitioning the Emperor,
that he might not be judged by the Civil Magistrate, but either
by a Council, or the Emperor himself, had severely rebuked them as
Strangers to, or Betrayers of, his inherent Right, acquainting them,
that, in virtue thereof, <i>all Men were to be judged by him, but himself
by no Man</i><a id='r1127' /><a href='#f1127' class='c015'><sup>[1127]</sup></a>; that <i>the greatest Monarchs were his Slaves and
Vassals, and he King of Kings, Monarch of the World, sole Lord
and Governor both in Spirituals and Temporals</i><a id='r1128' /><a href='#f1128' class='c015'><sup>[1128]</sup></a>; that <i>he was appointed
Prince over all Nations and Kingdoms</i><a id='r1129' /><a href='#f1129' class='c015'><sup>[1129]</sup></a>; that <i>his Power
excelled all Powers</i><a id='r1130' /><a href='#f1130' class='c015'><sup>[1130]</sup></a>; that <i>it was necessary to Salvation for every
human Creature to be subject to him</i><a id='r1131' /><a href='#f1131' class='c015'><sup>[1131]</sup></a>. And yet these are the Notions,
that have been uttered by his Successors, and the very Terms
in which they were uttered. In the Age I am now writing of, they
had been looked upon no otherwise than the Ravings of a distempered
Brain; but they are now held by the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and her Divines,
as Oracles, and inserted as such into her Canons. <i>Bellarmine</i>
owns, that, in the Fourth Century, the Pope was still subject
to the Emperors, nay, and to the Civil Magistrate, without the least
Distinction between him and other Vassals. <i>But this Subjection</i>, says
he, in his Apology against King <i>James</i><a id='r1132' /><a href='#f1132' class='c015'><sup>[1132]</sup></a>, <i>the Emperors exacted by
Force, because the Power of the Pope was not known to them</i>. Nor
to any body else, he might have added, since the Writers of those
Times seem to have been no better acquainted with the Power of
the Pope than the Emperors; at least, they take no Notice of it, even
in describing, as some of them have done, the State of the Church
at the time they writ, and relating the Customs, Laws, and Practices,
that then obtained. Besides, how could the Power of the Pope
be unknown to the Christian Emperors, if it was one of the chief
Tenets of the Christian Doctrine? Neither <i>Damasus</i>, nor any of his
Predecessors, can be justly charged with Bashfulness, in acquainting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>World with the Power they had or claimed. We may further observe
here, that the Emperor requires the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, in judging
according to the Power granted him, to act with the Advice of Five
or Seven other Bishops: a plain Proof, that he was as little acquainted
with the Pope’s Infallibility, as with his Power.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A new Accusation<br/>brought against</i><br/>Damasus.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Council of the <i>Italian</i> Bishops, assembled at <i>Rome</i>, no sooner
broke up, than the Emissaries and Partisans of <i>Ursinus</i> began to raise
new Disturbances in that City, by stirring up the Pagans against <i>Damasus</i>,
and, at the same time, charging him <i>with things</i>, to use the Expression
of the Council of <i>Aquileia</i>, <i>not fit to be uttered by a Bishop,
nor heard by such an Emperor as</i> Gratian<a id='r1133' /><a href='#f1133' class='c015'><sup>[1133]</sup></a>. <i>Anastasius</i> writes, that he
was accused of Adultery by the Two Deacons <i>Concordus</i> and <i>Callistus</i><a id='r1134' /><a href='#f1134' class='c015'><sup>[1134]</sup></a>.
And truly, that some Crime of that Nature was laid to his Charge, is
pretty plain, from the Terms in which it was expressed by the Council.
<i>Valerian</i>, then Governor of <i>Rome</i>, immediately acquainted the
Emperor with the Accusation<a id='r1135' /><a href='#f1135' class='c015'><sup>[1135]</sup></a>; but what Part <i>Gratian</i> acted on this
Occasion, we are not told by any antient Writer. We read in the Pontificals,
and most of the modern Writers, that the Cause was referred
by the Emperor to the Council then sitting at <i>Aquileia</i>; and that
<i>Damasus</i> was declared innocent by all the Bishops who composed it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council of</i><br/>Aquileia <i>writes to the<br/>Emperor in his<br/>Behalf</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But, as neither is related by any credible Author, I am inclined to
believe, that <i>Gratian</i> took no Notice of the Charge, in Compliance
with the Request of the Bishops assembled at <i>Aquileia</i>; for, by a
Letter, they earnestly intreated him not to hearken to <i>Ursinus</i>, because
his giving ear to him would occasion endless Disturbances in
<i>Rome</i>; and, besides, they could by no means communicate with a
Man who thus wickedly aspired to a Dignity, to which he had no
Claim or Title; who, by his scandalous Behaviour, had incurred the
Hatred of all good Christians; who had impiously joined the <i>Arians</i>,
and, together with them, attempted to disturb the Quiet of the Catholic
Church of <i>Milan</i><a id='r1136' /><a href='#f1136' class='c015'><sup>[1136]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A great Council as-<br/>sembled at</i> Con-<br/>stantinople, <i>by the<br/>Emperor</i> Theodosius.</div>

<p class='c001'>Towards the Latter end of the Pontificate of <i>Damasus</i>, Two great
Councils were held, the one at <i>Constantinople</i> in 381. and the other
at <i>Rome</i> in 382. The former was assembled by the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>,
who, after having put the Orthodox in Possession of the
Churches, which till his Time had been held by the <i>Arians</i> in the
East, where he reigned, summoned all the Bishops within his Dominions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>to meet at <i>Constantinople</i>, in order to deliberate about the most
proper Means of restoring an intire Tranquillity to the Church, rent
and disturbed not only by several Sects of Heretics, but by the Divisions
that reigned among the Orthodox themselves, by that especially of
<i>Antioch</i>, the most antient of all, which, from that Church, had
spread all over the Empire, and occasioned rather an intire Separation,
than a Misunderstanding between the East and the West, the former
communicating with <i>Meletius</i>, and the latter with <i>Paulinus</i>, as I
have related above. In this Council many weighty Matters were
transacted, and several Canons established, some of which, namely,
the Second and Third, deserve to be taken Notice of here. For, by
the Second, <i>the Council renewed and confirmed the antient Law of
the Church, authorized by the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Canons of
the Council of</i> Nice, commanding the Bishops of each Province to be
ordained by those of the same Province, and such of the neighbouring
Provinces, as they should think fit to call in; directing all Ecclesiastical
Matters to be settled, all Disputes to be finally decided by a Council
composed of the Bishops of the Province, or at least of the Diocese,
that is, of all the Provinces under the same Vicar; and strictly forbidding
the Bishops of one Diocese to concern themselves, under any
Colour or Pretence whatsoever, with what happens in another<a id='r1137' /><a href='#f1137' class='c015'><sup>[1137]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which revokes the<br/>Privilege granted to<br/>the See of</i> Rome<br/><i>by the Council of</i><br/>Sardica.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  By
this Canon the Privilege, formerly granted to the See of <i>Rome</i> by the
Council of <i>Sardica</i>, was revoked, and all Appeals from the Council
of the Diocese forbidden. By the Third Canon the See of <i><a id='corr217.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Constanstantinople'>Constantinople</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_217.23'><ins class='correction' title='Constanstantinople'>Constantinople</ins></a></span></i>
is declared first in Rank and Dignity after that of <i>Rome</i><a id='r1138' /><a href='#f1138' class='c015'><sup>[1138]</sup></a>.
Some <i>Greek</i> Writers have pretended, that, by this Canon, the Two
Sees were declared in every respect equal; but that <i>Zonaras</i> himself
owns to be false and groundless<a id='r1139' /><a href='#f1139' class='c015'><sup>[1139]</sup></a>. It is to be observed, that the
Council of <i>Constantinople</i> gave Rank and Honour to that See, but no
Jurisdiction. It was to the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i> that the Bishops of
<i>Constantinople</i> owed their Authority and Jurisdiction; for by that
Council they were impowered to ordain the Metropolitans of the
Dioceses of <i>Pontus</i>, <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Thrace</i><a id='r1140' /><a href='#f1140' class='c015'><sup>[1140]</sup></a>. The Reasons alleged by
<i>Baronius</i> to prove the Third Canon of the Council of <i>Constantinople</i>
supposititious<a id='r1141' /><a href='#f1141' class='c015'><sup>[1141]</sup></a>, are quite frivolous; and it is certain beyond all Dispute,
that the Bishops of that City maintained ever after the Rank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>which the above-mentioned Canon had given them. In a short time
the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, taking Advantage of that Canon, and
of the Deference that is naturally paid to the Bishop of the Imperial
City, extended his Jurisdiction over all the neighbouring Provinces,
nay, and over the whole Eastern Empire, as we shall observe in the
Sequel of this History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council writes to<br/>the Western Bishops.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Canons of this Council were, without all doubt, sent, according
to Custom, to the Western Bishops for their Approbation, probably
with the Letter which the Council writ to them concerning
the Heresy of <i>Apollinaris</i><a id='r1142' /><a href='#f1142' class='c015'><sup>[1142]</sup></a>. And yet Pope <i>Leo</i> the Great writes, that
the Third Canon was never notified to the Church of <i>Rome</i><a id='r1143' /><a href='#f1143' class='c015'><sup>[1143]</sup></a>; and
<i>Gregory</i> the Great, that the Canon condemning the <i>Eudoxians</i>, which
was the first, had never been received at <i>Rome</i><a id='r1144' /><a href='#f1144' class='c015'><sup>[1144]</sup></a>: but <i>Gregory</i> perhaps
meant nothing else, than that the Canon he mentions was of no
Authority at <i>Rome</i>. As for <i>Leo</i>, it is hard to conceive what he
meant by saying, that the Third Canon was not known to the Church
of <i>Rome</i>; for he could not but know, that the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>
held the Second Rank in the Church, and the First in the East,
since his own Legates, whose Conduct he intirely approved of, owned
him to have an indisputable Right to that Rank; nay, <i>Eusebius</i> Bishop
of <i>Dorylæum</i> in <i>Phrygia</i> maintained, that it was with the Consent
and Approbation of <i>Leo</i> himself that the See of <i>Constantinople</i>
enjoyed that Honour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Authority of this <br/>Council among the</i><br/>Greeks,</div>

<p class='c001'>The Authority of this Council has ever been great among the <i>Greeks</i>,
who style it an Oecumenical Council, and had often recourse to it as
such in the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i><a id='r1145' /><a href='#f1145' class='c015'><sup>[1145]</sup></a>. The Bishops of the <i>Hellespont</i>
speak of it with the greatest Respect and Reverence, in a Letter they
writ to the Emperor <i>Leo</i><a id='r1146' /><a href='#f1146' class='c015'><sup>[1146]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and the</i> Latins.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As for the <i>Latins</i>, I find a great Disagreement
among the Popes themselves concerning the Authority of
this Council; nay, the greatest of them all disagrees even with himself
about it. The Legates of Pope <i>Leo</i> rejected its Canons, alleging
that they had never been inserted in the Book of the Canons<a id='r1147' /><a href='#f1147' class='c015'><sup>[1147]</sup></a>. In
like manner the Popes <i>Simplicius</i> and <i>Felix</i> II. speaking of the Councils
which they received, name those only of <i>Nice</i>, <i>Ephesus</i>, and
<i>Chalcedon</i><a id='r1148' /><a href='#f1148' class='c015'><sup>[1148]</sup></a>. <i>Gregory the Great</i> writes, that the Church of <i>Rome</i> had
neither the Acts nor the Canons of the Council of <i>Constantinople</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>that the Condemnation of the <i>Macedonians</i> was the only thing done
by that Council which they admitted; and that as to other Heresies
condemned there, they rejected them, as having been condemned before
by other Councils<a id='r1149' /><a href='#f1149' class='c015'><sup>[1149]</sup></a>. But he declares elsewhere, and often repeats
it, that he received the Four Oecumenical Councils, as he did
the Four Gospels<a id='r1150' /><a href='#f1150' class='c015'><sup>[1150]</sup></a>, naming the Council of <i>Constantinople</i> in the Second
Place. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Popes at Var-<br/>iance among and with<br/>themselves about it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In the same Manner, and with the same Words, were
the Four Oecumenical Councils received by <i>Gelasius</i>, and several Popes
before him, as well as by <i>Martin</i> I. and several others after him:
so that the Council of <i>Constantinople</i> is, according to some Popes, of
equal Authority with the Gospel; according to others, of no Authority
at all: nay, it is thus by the same Pope at one time extolled, at
another undervalued. Let <i>Baronius</i> and <i>Bellarmine</i> reconcile these
Contradictions, if they can.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>This Council was<br/>assembled by the<br/>Emperor, and not by</i><br/>Damasus.</div>

<p class='c001'>That this Council was assembled by the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, is
affirmed by all the Writers who speak of it<a id='r1151' /><a href='#f1151' class='c015'><sup>[1151]</sup></a>, nay, and by the Bishops
who composed it<a id='r1152' /><a href='#f1152' class='c015'><sup>[1152]</sup></a>. And yet <i>Baronius</i> has the Assurance to assert, <i>as
a Thing not to be questioned</i>, that it was convened by <i>Damasus</i><a id='r1153' /><a href='#f1153' class='c015'><sup>[1153]</sup></a>,
which none of the Antients have so much as once named: and this
Assertion he founds upon the Authority of the universally exploded
Acts of <i>Damasus</i>; of certain Manuscripts, which he knows very little
of, and nobody else any thing; and of a Passage in the Acts of the
Sixth Oecumenical Council, where it is said, that <i>Theodosius</i> and <i>Damasus</i>
opposed with great Firmness the <i>Macedonian</i> Heresy; whence
the Annalist concludes, by what Rules of Logic I leave the Reader to
find out, that the Council, which condemned the Heresy of <i>Macedonius</i>,
was convened by the Authority of <i>Damasus</i>, backed by that of
the Emperor<a id='r1154' /><a href='#f1154' class='c015'><sup>[1154]</sup></a>. <i>Christianus Lupus</i>, more honest than <i>Baronius</i>, tho’
no less attached to the See of <i>Rome</i>, ingenuously owns, that the Council
was assembled by the Emperor alone; but adds, that <i>Damasus</i> confirmed
it<a id='r1155' /><a href='#f1155' class='c015'><sup>[1155]</sup></a>; which is true, if he means no more than that <i>Damasus</i>
accepted the Decrees made by the Council; for it was not his, but the
Emperor’s Approbation, that gave them a Sanction; and accordingly
they writ, not to him, but to the Emperor, acquainting him;
<i>by whose Command they had been called together</i>, with the Decrees
they had made, and requesting him to confirm them <i>with his Seal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and Sentence</i><a id='r1156' /><a href='#f1156' class='c015'><sup>[1156]</sup></a>. This Council consisted of an Hundred and Fifty Bishops,
among whom were Thirty-six <i>Macedonians</i>, whom <i>Theodosius</i>
had particularly summoned, hoping to reunite them with the Catholics<a id='r1157' /><a href='#f1157' class='c015'><sup>[1157]</sup></a>.
No mention is made of Letters or Deputies sent either by
<i>Damasus</i>, or by any of the Western Bishops; and <i>Theodoret</i> assures
us in Two different Places<a id='r1158' /><a href='#f1158' class='c015'><sup>[1158]</sup></a>, that <i>Theodosius</i> only assembled the Eastern
Bishops. <i>Meletius</i> of <i>Antioch</i> presided; for <i>Gregory</i> of <i>Nyssa</i> styled
him in full Council, <i>our Father and Head</i><a id='r1159' /><a href='#f1159' class='c015'><sup>[1159]</sup></a>. Upon his Death (for he
died while the Council was sitting) that Honour was conferred on
<i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, appointed by the Emperor and the Council Bishop
of <i>Constantinople</i><a id='r1160' /><a href='#f1160' class='c015'><sup>[1160]</sup></a>; but he resigning, soon after, his new Dignity,
his Successor <i>Nectarius</i> was named to preside in his room<a id='r1161' /><a href='#f1161' class='c015'><sup>[1161]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the chief Motives that induced <i>Theodosius</i> to assemble so
numerous a Council at <i>Constantinople</i>, was, to hear what Remedy they
could suggest against the Schism of the Church of <i>Antioch</i>, which
caused such Jealousies between the East and the West as seemed to
forebode an imminent Rupture<a id='r1162' /><a href='#f1162' class='c015'><sup>[1162]</sup></a>. But before the Fathers of the Council
entered upon that important Subject, <i>Meletius</i> died; and his Death,
which ought to have put an End to the present Disturbances, served
only to increase them, and engage the contending Parties more warmly
in the Dispute. It had been agreed by <i>Meletius</i> and <i>Paulinus</i>, that
the Survivor should be sole Bishop of all the Orthodox at <i>Antioch</i><a id='r1163' /><a href='#f1163' class='c015'><sup>[1163]</sup></a>.
<i>Socrates</i> and <i>Sozomen</i> add<a id='r1164' /><a href='#f1164' class='c015'><sup>[1164]</sup></a>, that Six Presbyters, who it was most
likely might be one Day raised to that See, bound themselves by a
solemn Oath not to vote for any other, nor to accept themselves the
Episcopal Dignity, so long as either of the Two lived. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Disturbances in<br/>the Church of</i> Antioch<br/><i>increased</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However,
<i>Meletius</i> was no sooner dead, than some of the Prelates present at the
Council moved for chusing him a Successor, which occasioned many
long and warm Debates. <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, elected Bishop of
<i>Constantinople</i> a few Days before, exerted all his Eloquence to divert
the Council from a Resolution, which, he said, would prove fatal to
the Church, and kindle a Flame, which perhaps it might never be in
their Power to extinguish<a id='r1165' /><a href='#f1165' class='c015'><sup>[1165]</sup></a>. Several other Prelates, Enemies to Strife
and Contention, falling in with <i>Gregory</i>, spoke to the same Purpose,
exhorting their Collegues, with great Zeal and Eloquence, to put an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>End at last to the unhappy Divisions that had so long rent the Church,
by allowing <i>Paulinus</i>, already stricken in Years, to govern peaceably
the remaining Part of his Life<a id='r1166' /><a href='#f1166' class='c015'><sup>[1166]</sup></a>. But the far greater Part were for a
new Election, offering no other Reason to recommend such a Step,
but that the East, where our Saviour had appeared, ought not to yield
to the West<a id='r1167' /><a href='#f1167' class='c015'><sup>[1167]</sup></a>. So that the Resolution of giving a Successor to <i>Meletius</i>
was taken merely out of Pique to the Western Bishops, who,
having the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> at their Head, had begun to treat their
Brethren in the East with great Haughtiness, and assume an Air of
Authority that did not become them; but that had been better resented
on any other Occasion than on this.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Flavianus <i>ordained<br/>Bishop of</i> Antioch.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Resolution being taken, <i>Flavianus</i>, a Presbyter of the Church
of <i>Antioch</i>, was named by the Council, and, with the Approbation
of the Emperor, and of all the <i>Meletians</i> at <i>Antioch</i>, ordained in that
City. He is commended by the Writers who lived in or near those
Times, as a Man of an exemplary Life, and extraordinary Piety, as
a zealous Defender of the Orthodox Faith, and Opposer of the <i>Arian</i>
Heresy, as a Mirror of every Sacerdotal Virtue; and, barring the
Right of <i>Paulinus</i>, the most worthy and deserving Person the Council
could name to succeed the great <i>Meletius</i><a id='r1168' /><a href='#f1168' class='c015'><sup>[1168]</sup></a>. These, and other like
Encomiums, bestowed upon <i>Flavianus</i> by the Writers of those Times,
leave no room to doubt but <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Sozomen</i> were misinformed
in naming him among the Six Presbyters who took the Oath I have
mentioned above; the rather as no notice is taken of such an Oath by
his most inveterate Enemies, in the many Disputes that arose about
his Ordination. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Greg. Nazianzen<br/><i>resigns the Bishoprick<br/>of</i> Constantinople.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, who had been lately preferred

other View, but to remove all Jealousies, and restore a good Understanding
between the East and the West, being sensible that the electing
of a new Bishop in the room of <i>Meletius</i> would widen the Breach,
and obstruct all possible Means of an Accommodation, resigned his
Dignity, and, to the inexpressible Grief of his Flock, retired both
from the Council and City<a id='r1169' /><a href='#f1169' class='c015'><sup>[1169]</sup></a>.  In one of his Orations<a id='r1170' /><a href='#f1170' class='c015'><sup>[1170]</sup></a>, he ascribes
this Resolution to the Divisions that reigned among the Bishops, declaring
that he was quite tired with their constant quarreling and bickering
among themselves, and comparing them to Children at Play;
whom to join in their childish Diversions, would be degrading a serious

to succeed him; but, as to the Particulars of his Election, they are
variously related by Authors, and foreign to my Purpose. He was a Native
of <i>Tarsus</i> in <i>Cilicia</i>, descended of an illustrious and senatorial
Family, but at the Time of his Election still a Layman, and Prætor of
<i>Constantinople</i>; nay, he had not been baptized<a id='r1171' /><a href='#f1171' class='c015'><sup>[1171]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i><br/>Aquileia <i>writes to</i><br/>Theodosius <i>in favour<br/>of</i> Paulinus.</div>

<p class='c001'>The same Year that the Eastern Bishops met at <i>Constantinople</i>, by
the Command of <i>Theodosius</i>, the Western Bishops met at <i>Aquileia</i>,
by the Command of <i>Gratian</i>.  While the latter were yet sitting,
News was brought of the Death of <i>Meletius</i>, and at the same time
they received certain Intelligence of the Resolution which the Council
of <i>Constantinople</i> had taken of appointing him a Successor. Hereupon
having dispatched the Business for which they had met, and condemned
<i>Palladius</i> and <i>Secundianus</i>, the only Two <i>Arian</i> Bishops
now in the West, they dispatched some Presbyters into the East, with
a Letter to the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, wherein, after expressing the Joy
it had given them to hear that the Orthodox in those Parts were at
last happily delivered from the Oppression of the <i>Arians</i>, they complained
of the Hardships <i>Paulinus</i> had met with, whom they had
always acknowleged as lawful Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, put the Emperor
in mind of the Agreement between <i>Paulinus</i> and <i>Meletius</i>, and concluded
with intreating him to assemble an Oecumenical Council at
<i>Alexandria</i>, as the only Means of restoring Tranquillity to the Church,
and settling a perfect Harmony amongst her Members<a id='r1172' /><a href='#f1172' class='c015'><sup>[1172]</sup></a>. Before this
Letter reached the Emperor, the Council of <i>Constantinople</i> was concluded,
and the Bishops returned to their respective Sees. However,
<i>Theodosius</i> recalled some of them, in order to govern himself by their
Advice in granting or denying the Western Bishops their Request<a id='r1173' /><a href='#f1173' class='c015'><sup>[1173]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>And the Bishops of</i><br/>Italy <i>in favour of</i><br/>Maximus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the Election of <i>Flavianus</i> being in the mean time known in the
West, the Bishops of the Vicariate of <i>Italy</i>, them assembled in Council
with <i>Ambrose</i> Bishop of <i>Milan</i> at their Head, writ a long Letter
to <i>Theodosius</i> complaining of that Election, openly espousing at the
same time the Cause of <i>Maximus</i> against <i>Nectarius</i>, the new Bishop
of <i>Constantinople</i>, and threatening to separate themselves intirely from
the Communion of the Eastern Bishops, unless <i>Maximus</i> was acknowleged
lawful Bishop of that City, or at least an Oecumenical Council
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>was assembled to examine the Claims of the Two Competitors, and
to confirm with their joint Suffrages the disputed Dignity to him, who
had the best<a id='r1174' /><a href='#f1174' class='c015'><sup>[1174]</sup></a>. They also desired, in the same Letter, to have the
Contest between <i>Paulinus</i> and <i>Flavianus</i> decided.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Who</i> Maximus <i>was,<br/>and how chosen Bis-<br/>hop of</i> Constantinople.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Maximus</i>, surnamed the <i>Cynic</i>, because he had from his Youth
professed the Philosophy, and wore the Habit, of that Sect, was a Man
of a most infamous Character, and had been publicly whipt in <i>Egypt</i>,
his native Country, and confined to the City of <i>Oasis</i>, for Crimes not
to be mentioned<a id='r1175' /><a href='#f1175' class='c015'><sup>[1175]</sup></a>. Being released from his Banishment, he wandered
all over the East, and was every where equally abhorred and
detested on account of his matchless Impudence and scandalous Manners<a id='r1176' /><a href='#f1176' class='c015'><sup>[1176]</sup></a>.
At last he repaired to <i>Constantinople</i>, where he had not been
long, when, by one of the boldest Attempts mentioned in History,
he caused himself to be installed and ordained Bishop of that City:
for the Doors of the Church being broken open in the Dead of the
Night, by a Band of <i>Egyptian</i> Mariners, he was placed on the Episcopal
Chair in the profane Dress of a <i>Cynic</i>, by some Bishops whom
his Friends had sent out of <i>Egypt</i> for that Purpose. But the People,
and some of the Clergy, in the adjoining Houses, being alarmed at
the Noise, and crouding to see what occasioned it, <i>Maximus</i> and his
unhallowed Crew thought fit to withdraw, and complete the Ceremony
in a Place better adapted to such a Scene of Profaneness, the
House of a Player on the Flute<a id='r1177' /><a href='#f1177' class='c015'><sup>[1177]</sup></a>. <i>Maximus</i>, thus ordained, in equal
Defiance of the Imperial Laws and Canons of the Church, had the
Assurance to claim the See of <i>Constantinople</i> as his Right, and to protest
against the Election of <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, and likewise of <i>Nectarius</i>,
who was chosen upon the Resignation of <i>Gregory</i>, tho’ they
had both been named to that Dignity by the Council of <i>Constantinople</i>,
that is, by all the Eastern Bishops. But no Regard being had
to his Protest, nay, his Ordination being declared null by the Council,
and he driven out of the City by the Populace, and rejected with
Indignation by the Emperor, he had recourse to the Bishops of the
Vicariate of <i>Italy</i>, then assembled in Council with <i>Ambrose</i> Bishop
of <i>Milan</i> at their Head, as I have observed above. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is acknowleged by</i><br/>Ambrose, <i>and the</i><br/>Italian <i>Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  These giving an
intire Credit to the Accounts of the lying and deceitful <i>Cynic</i>, as they
were quite unacquainted with what had passed in the East, not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>admitted him to their Communion, but, without farther Inquiry or Examination,
acknowleged him for lawful Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, and
writ the above-mentioned Letter to <i>Theodosius</i> in his Behalf<a id='r1178' /><a href='#f1178' class='c015'><sup>[1178]</sup></a>. We
must not confound this Council with that of <i>Aquileia</i>, as I find most
Writers have done: for the latter was composed of almost all the
Western Bishops under <i>Valerian</i> Bishop of the Place; whereas the
Council I am now speaking of, consisted only of the Bishops of the
Vicariate of <i>Italy</i>, under the Bishop of <i>Milan</i> their Metropolitan.
It is surprising that <i>Ambrose</i>, and the other Bishops of that Council,
should not have been better informed with respect to the Ordination
of <i>Maximus</i>, since <i>Acholius</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i>, with Five
other Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>, had, at least a Year before, transmitted to
<i>Damasus</i> a minute Account of it, agreeing in every Particular with
that which I have given above from <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i><a id='r1179' /><a href='#f1179' class='c015'><sup>[1179]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Emperor’s Ans-<br/>wer to their Letter.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The
Letter from the Council caused no small Surprize in <i>Theodosius</i>:
he was sensible they had suffered themselves to be grosly imposed
upon; but, not judging it necessary to undeceive them, he only told
them, in his Answer to their Letter, that the Reasons they alleged
did not seem sufficient to him for assembling an Oecumenical Council,
and giving so much Trouble to the Prelates of the Church; that
they were not to concern themselves with what happened in the East,
nor remove the Bounds, that had been wisely placed by their Fore-fathers
between the East and the West; and that, as to the Affair of
<i>Maximus</i>, by espousing his Cause they had betrayed either an unwarrantable
Animosity against the Orientals, or an inexcusable Credulity
in giving Credit to false and groundless Reports<a id='r1180' /><a href='#f1180' class='c015'><sup>[1180]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A Council of all the<br/>Western Bishops<br/>assembled at</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>Upon the Receipt of this Letter, the <i>Italian</i> Bishops, finding <i>Theodosius</i>
no ways disposed to assemble an Oecumenical Council, applied
to <i>Gratian</i>, who not only granted them Leave to meet at <i>Rome</i>, the
Place they chose, but dispatched Letters to all the Bishops both in
the East and West, giving them Notice of the Time and Place, in
which the Council was to be held, and inviting them to it<a id='r1181' /><a href='#f1181' class='c015'><sup>[1181]</sup></a>. But
of all the Eastern Bishops, Two only complied with this Invitation;
<i>viz.</i> <i>Epiphanius</i> Bishop of <i>Salamis</i> in the Island of <i>Cyprus</i>, and <i>Paulinus</i>,
whom all the West acknowleged for lawful Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>.
The Western Bishops were all present, either in Person, or by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Deputies; and <i>Damasus</i> presided<a id='r1182' /><a href='#f1182' class='c015'><sup>[1182]</sup></a>. But, as to the Transactions of
this great Assembly, we are almost intirely in the Dark; for all we
know of them is, that they unanimously agreed not to communicate
with <i>Flavianus</i>, the new Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, nor with <i>Diodorus</i> of
<i>Tarsus</i>, or <i>Acacius</i> of <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, who had been chiefly instrumental in
his Promotion; that they condemned the Heresy of <i>Apollinaris</i>; and
that, at the Request of <i>Damasus</i>, a Confession of Faith was drawn
up by <i>Jerom</i>, and approved by the Council, which the <i>Apollinarists</i>
were to sign, upon their being re-admitted to the Communion of the
Church<a id='r1183' /><a href='#f1183' class='c015'><sup>[1183]</sup></a>. As for <i>Maximus</i>, they seem to have abandoned his
Cause, being, in all Likelihood, undeceived, with respect to his
Ordination, by <i>Acholius</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i>, and St. <i>Jerom</i>, who
assisted at the Council, and could not be Strangers to the Character
of <i>Maximus</i>, nor unacquainted with the scandalous Methods by
which he had attained the Episcopal Dignity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Misunderstanding between the East and the West increased.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Resolution they took not to communicate with <i>Flavianus</i>,
whose Election, though imprudently made, was undoubtedly Canonical,
and had been approved and confirmed by the Oecumenical Council
of <i>Constantinople</i>, not only increased the Jealousies and Misunderstanding
between the East and the West, but occasioned a great
Disagreement, and endless Quarrels, among the Eastern Bishops themselves.
For those who acknowleged <i>Paulinus</i>, <i>viz.</i> the Bishops of
<i>Egypt</i>, of the Island of <i>Cyprus</i>, of <i>Arabia</i>, insisted upon the Deposition
of <i>Flavianus</i><a id='r1184' /><a href='#f1184' class='c015'><sup>[1184]</sup></a>. <i>Nestorius</i> mentions some Letters, written by
the Bishops of <i>Egypt</i> against <i>Flavianus</i>, with great Virulency, and
a <i>tyrannical Spirit</i>, to use his Expression<a id='r1185' /><a href='#f1185' class='c015'><sup>[1185]</sup></a>. On the other hand, the
Bishops of <i>Syria</i>, of <i>Palæstine</i>, of <i>Ph&oelig;nicia</i>, <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>,
<i>Galatia</i>, <i>Pontus</i>, <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Thrace</i>, not only maintained, with equal
Warmth, the Election of <i>Flavianus</i>, but began to treat their Brethren
in the East, who had joined the Western Bishops against them,
as Schismatics, as Betrayers of their Trust, as Transgressors of the
Canons of <i>Nice</i>, commanding the Elections and Ordinations of each
Province to be made and performed by the Bishops of the same Province,
and all Disputes concerning them to be finally decided in
the Place where they had begun<a id='r1186' /><a href='#f1186' class='c015'><sup>[1186]</sup></a>. This Schism occasioned great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Confusion in the Church, which continued till the Year 398, when
<i>Chrysostom</i>, after having, with indefatigable Pains, long laboured in
vain to bring about an Accommodation between the East and the
West, had at last, soon after his Promotion to the See of <i>Constantinople</i>,
the Satisfaction of seeing his pious Endeavours crowned with
Success, as I shall relate in a more proper Place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>No Regard paid by the Eastern Bishops to the Judgment of the Pope.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>From this whole Account it is manifest, as the Reader must have
observed, that the Orientals paid no manner of Regard either to the
Judgment of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, or to that of the whole Body of

they well knew the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and his Collegues in the West,
to be warmly engaged in favour of <i>Paulinus</i>, yet they refused to
acknowlege him, even after the Death of <i>Meletius</i>; and therefore
raised <i>Flavianus</i> to the See of <i>Antioch</i>, in the room of <i>Meletius</i>, and
confirmed that Election in an Oecumenical Council. The Western
Bishops exclaimed against it, desiring it might be referred to the Decision
of a General Council. But not even to that Demand would
the Orientals agree, thinking, as they declared in their Answer, that
there was no Occasion for a Council, since <i>Flavianus</i> had been chosen
and ordained by the Bishops of the Diocese, which was all the Canons
of <i>Nice</i> required. They therefore exhorted them to divest themselves
of all Prejudices, to sacrifice all private Affections to the Peace and
Unity of the Church, and to put an End to the present, and prevent
all future, Disputes, by approving, with their joint Suffrages, an
Election which had been approved and confirmed by an Oecumenical
Council<a id='r1187' /><a href='#f1187' class='c015'><sup>[1187]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Custom of ap-<br/>pointing Vicars intro-<br/>duced by</i> Damasus,<br/><i>and on what Oc-<br/>casion</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>To return to <i>Damasus</i>: He was the first who introduced the Custom,
which his Successors took care to improve, of conferring on
certain Bishops the Title of their Vicars, pretending thereby to impart
to them an extraordinary Power, enabling them to perform
several Things, which they could not perform in virtue of their own.
<i>Acholius</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i> was the first who enjoyed this Title,
being, by <i>Damasus</i>, appointed his Vicar in <i>East Illyricum</i>, on the
following Occasion: <i>Illyricum</i>, comprising all antient <i>Greece</i>, and
many Provinces on the <i>Danube</i>, whereof <i>Sirmium</i> was the Capital,
had, ever since the Time of <i>Constantine</i>, belonged to the Western
Empire. But, in the Year 379. <i>Dacia</i> and <i>Greece</i> were, by <i>Gratian</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>disjoined from the more Westerly Provinces, and added, in favour of
<i>Theodosius</i>, to the Eastern Empire, being known by the Name of
<i>East Illyricum</i>, whereof <i>Thessalonica</i>, the Metropolis of <i>Macedon</i>,
was the chief City. The Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, as presiding in the Metropolis
of the Empire, had begun to claim a kind of Jurisdiction,
or rather Inspection in Ecclesiastical Matters, over all the Provinces of
the Western Empire; which was the first great Step by which they
ascended to the Supremacy they afterwards claimed and established.
This <i>Damasus</i> was unwilling to resign with respect to <i>Illyricum</i>, even
after that Country was dismembered from the Western, and added to
the Eastern Empire. In order therefore to maintain his Claim, he
appointed <i>Acholius</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i> to act in his stead, vesting
in him the Power which he pretended to have over those Provinces.
Upon the Death of <i>Acholius</i> he conferred the same Dignity on his
Successor <i>Anysius</i>, as did the following Popes on the succeeding Bishops
of <i>Thessalonica</i>, who, by thus supporting the Pretensions of
<i>Rome</i>, became the first Bishops, and, in a manner, the Patriarchs, of
<i>East Illyricum</i>; for they are sometimes distinguished with that Title.
This, however, was not done without Opposition, the other Metropolitans
not readily acknowleging for their Superior one who, till
that time, had been their Equal<a id='r1188' /><a href='#f1188' class='c015'><sup>[1188]</sup></a>. <i>Syricius</i>, who succeeded <i>Damasus</i>,
inlarging the Power claimed by his Predecessor, decreed, that no
Bishop should be ordained in <i>East Illyricum</i> without the Consent and
Approbation of the Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i><a id='r1189' /><a href='#f1189' class='c015'><sup>[1189]</sup></a>. But it was some time
before this Decree took place. Pope <i>Innocent</i> I. writes, that his Predecessors
committed to the Care of <i>Acholius</i>, <i>Achaia</i>, <i>Thessaly</i>, the
Two <i>Epirus’s</i>, <i>Candia</i>, the Two <i>Dacia’s</i>, <i>M&oelig;sia</i>, <i>Dardania</i>, and
<i>Prævalitana</i>, now Part of <i>Albania</i>, impowering him to judge and
decide the Controversies that might arise there, and appointing him
to be <i>the first among the Primates, without prejudicing the Primacy
of those Churches</i><a id='r1190' /><a href='#f1190' class='c015'><sup>[1190]</sup></a>. Thus were the Bishops of <i>Thessalonica</i> first appointed
Vicars or Vicegerents of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, probably in
the Year 382. for in that Year <i>Acholius</i> assisted at the Council of
<i>Rome</i>, and it was, in all Likelihood, on that Occasion that <i>Damasus</i>
vested him with this new Dignity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Institution of Vicars improved by the succeeding Popes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Contrivance of <i>Damasus</i>
was notably improved by his Successors, who, in order to extend and
inlarge their Authority, conferred the Title of their Vicars, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>pretended Power annexed to it, on the most eminent Prelates of
other Provinces and Kingdoms, engaging them thereby to depend
upon them, and to promote the Authority of their See, to the utter
Suppression of the antient Rights and Liberties both of Bishops and
Synods. This Dignity was for the most part annexed to certain Sees,
but sometimes conferred on particular Persons. Thus was <i>Austin</i>
appointed the Pope’s Vicar in <i>England</i>, <i>Boniface</i> in <i>Germany</i>; and
both, in virtue of the Power which they pretended to have been imparted
to them with that Title, usurped and exercised an Authority
above that of Metropolitans. The Institution of Vicars was, by the
succeeding Popes, improved into that of Legates, or, to use <i>De
Marca</i>’s Expression, the latter Institution was grafted on the former<a id='r1191' /><a href='#f1191' class='c015'><sup>[1191]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Legates vested with<br/>greater Power than<br/>Vicars.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Legates were vested with a far greater Power than the Vicars, or,
as Pope <i>Leo</i> expresses it, <i>were admitted to a far greater Share of his
Care, though not to the Plenitude of his Power</i><a id='r1192' /><a href='#f1192' class='c015'><sup>[1192]</sup></a>. They were sent
on proper Occasions into all Countries, and never failed exerting, to
the utmost Stretch, their boasted Power, oppressing, in virtue of their
paramount Authority, the Clergy as well as the People, and extorting
from both large Sums, to support the Pomp and Luxury in which
they lived.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Custom of appointing Vicars and Legates may well be alleged
as a remarkable Instance of the Craft and Policy of the Popes, since,
of all the Methods they ever devised (and many they have devised)
to extend and establish their Power, none has better answered their
ambitious Views. But how <i>Bellarmine</i> could lay so much Stress
upon it as he does<a id='r1193' /><a href='#f1193' class='c015'><sup>[1193]</sup></a>, to prove, that the Pope has, by <i>Divine Right</i>,
a sovereign Authority and Jurisdiction over all the Churches of the
Earth, is unconceivable. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The sending Legates<br/>no Proof of the Pope’s<br/>universal Jurisdiction.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For it is certain, beyond all Dispute, that
such a Custom had never been heard of till the Time of <i>Damasus</i>,
that is, till the Latter-end of the Fourth Century, when it was first introduced,
upon the dismembering of <i>East Illyricum</i>, by <i>Gratian</i>, from
the Western Empire. <i>Damasus</i> did not even then claim that sovereign
and unlimited Power, with which <i>Bellarmine</i> is pleased to vest
him, but only a kind of Inspection over the Provinces of the Western
Empire, as Bishop of the first See. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Disingenuity of</i><br/>Bellarmine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  And here I cannot help observing
the Disingenuity of <i>Bellarmine</i>, who, in speaking of this Institution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>expresses himself thus: Leo <i>appointed</i> Anastiasius <i>Bishop of</i> Thessalonica
<i>his Vicar in the East, in the same manner as the Predecessors
of</i> Anastasius <i>had been Vicars to the Predecessors of</i> Leo<a id='r1194' /><a href='#f1194' class='c015'><sup>[1194]</sup></a>.
From these Words every Reader would naturally conclude, and <i>Bellarmine</i>
designs they should, that the Bishops of <i>Thessalonica</i> had been
the Pope’s Vicars from the Beginning, or Time out of Mind; whereas
it is certain, that this Institution had taken place but a few Years before.
Pope <i>Leo</i> I. in conferring on <i>Anastasius</i> the <i>Vicariate Dignity
of his See</i>, as he styles it, declared, that he followed therein the Example
of his Predecessor <i>Syricius</i><a id='r1195' /><a href='#f1195' class='c015'><sup>[1195]</sup></a>, <i>who first appointed</i> Anysius <i>to act
in his stead</i>. But he was doubly mistaken; for these Vicars were first
instituted, as is notorious, by <i>Damasus</i>, and not by <i>Syricius</i>; and it
was not by <i>Syricius</i>, but by <i>Damasus</i>, that <i>Anysius</i> was vested with
that Dignity<a id='r1196' /><a href='#f1196' class='c015'><sup>[1196]</sup></a>. The Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i> is styled, by the antient
Writers, the Pope’s Vicar in <i>East Illyricum</i>, which is manifestly confining
his Vicariate Jurisdiction to that District; but <i>Bellarmine</i> extends
it at once all over the East, by distinguishing him with the Title of
<i>the Popes Vicar for the East</i><a id='r1197' /><a href='#f1197' class='c015'><sup>[1197]</sup></a>. But how little Regard was paid to
the Pope’s Authority in the East, I have sufficiently shewn above.</p>

<p class='c001'>I find nothing else in the antient Writers concerning <i>Damasus</i>
worthy of Notice, besides his generously undertaking the Defence of
<i>Symmachus</i>, who, being Prefect of <i>Rome</i> in 384. the last Year of <i>Damasus</i>’s
Life, and a <i>sworn</i> Enemy to the Christians, was falsly accused
to the Emperor, as if he had with great Cruelty persecuted and oppressed
them. But <i>Damasus</i> had the Generosity to take his Part, and
clear him, by a Letter he writ to the Emperor, from that Charge<a id='r1198' /><a href='#f1198' class='c015'><sup>[1198]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Damasus <i>dies</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This was one of the last Actions of <i>Damasus</i>’s Life; for he died this
Year on the 10th or 11th of <i>December</i>, being then in the Eightieth
Year of his Age, after he had governed the Church of <i>Rome</i> for the
Space of Eighteen Years, and about Two Months<a id='r1199' /><a href='#f1199' class='c015'><sup>[1199]</sup></a>. He was buried,
according to <i>Anastasius</i><a id='r1200' /><a href='#f1200' class='c015'><sup>[1200]</sup></a>, near his Mother and Sister, in a Church
which he had built at the Catacombs, on the Way to <i>Ardea</i>; whence
that Place, though Part of the C&oelig;metery of <i>Calixtus</i>, is by some
called the C&oelig;metery of <i>Damasus</i><a id='r1201' /><a href='#f1201' class='c015'><sup>[1201]</sup></a>. He proposed at first being buried
near the Remains of St. <i>Sixtus</i>, and his Companions; but afterwards
changed his Mind, lest he should disturb the Ashes of the Saints<a id='r1202' /><a href='#f1202' class='c015'><sup>[1202]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>He caused the Church of St. <i>Laurence</i>, near the Theatre of <i>Pompey</i>,
probably that which his Father and he himself had formerly served,
to be rebuilt, inlarged, and embellished; Whence it is still known by
the joint Titles of St. <i>Laurence</i> and <i>Damasus</i><a id='r1203' /><a href='#f1203' class='c015'><sup>[1203]</sup></a>. In that Church his
Body is worshiped to this Day. But, how or when it was removed
thither, nobody knows<a id='r1204' /><a href='#f1204' class='c015'><sup>[1204]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Decrees ascribed<br/>to him suppositious.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Several Decrees are ascribed to <i>Damasus</i>
by <i>Gratian</i>, <i>Ivo</i> of <i>Chartres</i>, <i>Anastasius</i>, and others, but all evidently
forged by some Impostor blindly addicted to the See of <i>Rome</i>, and
quite unacquainted with the Discipline of the Church in the Fourth
Century. In one of them a Canon is quoted from the Council of
Nice, forbidding the Laity to eat or drink of any thing that was <i>offered
to the holy Priests</i>, because none but the <i>Jewish</i> Priests were allowed
to eat of the Bread that was offered on the Altar. We know of no such
Canon; and besides, it is not at all probable, that the Council of <i>Nice</i>
would have restrained the Clergy from sharing at least with the Poor
what was offered them. In another of these Decrees the Paying of
Tythes is commanded, on pain of Excommunication; whereas it
might be easily made appear, that, in the Fourth Century, the Offerings
destined for the Maintenance of the Clergy were still voluntary.
Another Decree supposes, that, by an antient Custom, all Metropolitans
swore Fealty to the Apostolic See, and could ordain no Bishops
till they had received the Pall from <i>Rome</i>. For the Sake of this, <i>Baronius</i>
admits all the rest: but of such a Custom not the least Mention,
or distant Hint, is to be met with in any antient Writer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Writings in Prose and Verse.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><i>Damasus</i> is ranked by <i>Jerom</i><a id='r1205' /><a href='#f1205' class='c015'><sup>[1205]</sup></a> among the Ecclesiastical Writers,
on account of the many small Pieces he writ, chiefly in Verse; for
he had a particular Genius for Poetry, and was no despicable Poet, if
some Compositions ascribed to him were truly his. He writ several
Books, both in Prose and Verse, in Commendation of Virginity; but
neither that, nor any of his other Works, has reached our Times, besides
some Letters, and a few Epitaphs, Inscriptions, and Epigrams,
which have been carefully collected by <i>Baronius</i><a id='r1206' /><a href='#f1206' class='c015'><sup>[1206]</sup></a>, though it may be
justly questioned whether the several Pieces ascribed to him by that
Writer were written by him. A short History of the first Popes,
styled, <i>The Pontifical of</i> Damasus, and published together with the
Councils, has long passed for the Work of <i>Damasus</i>; but now even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span><i>Baronius</i> owns it not to be his; and most Critics are of Opinion, that
it was written after the Time of <i>Gregory the Great</i>; nay, some ascribe
it to <i>Anastasius Bibliothecarius</i>, who flourished in the Ninth Century<a id='r1207' /><a href='#f1207' class='c015'><sup>[1207]</sup></a>.
As for his Letters, those to <i>Aurelius</i> of <i>Carthage</i>, to <i>Stephen</i>, styled,
<i>Archbishop of the Council of</i> Mauritania, to <i>Prosper</i> Primate of <i>Numidia</i>,
to the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, are all spurious, as well as the Letters
to which some of them are Answers, and supposed to have been forged
by that notorious Impostor <i>Isidorus Mercator</i><a id='r1208' /><a href='#f1208' class='c015'><sup>[1208]</sup></a>. His genuine Letters
are the Two, that are to be found among the Works of <i>Jerom</i>,
to whom they were written; Two to <i>Acholius</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i>,
published by <i>Holstenius</i> in his <i>Collection of the antient Monuments
of the Church of</i> Rome<a id='r1209' /><a href='#f1209' class='c015'><sup>[1209]</sup></a>; a Letter of great Length to <i>Paulinus</i>
of <i>Antioch</i>, whereof the chief Heads are set down by <i>Theodoret</i>
in his History, as are likewise those of his Letter to the Orientals concerning
<i>Timotheus</i>, the favourite Disciple of <i>Apollinaris</i>. Several Letters
from the Councils, that were held in <i>Rome</i> in his Time, and at
which he presided, are still extant, and may well be ascribed to him.
The Two Letters to <i>Jerom</i> are well worth perusing, being written
in a pure, easy, and elegant Style, and with a great deal of Spirit,
Vivacity, and even Gaiety, though <i>Damasus</i> was then much advanced
in Years, and overburdened with Cares and Business<a id='r1210' /><a href='#f1210' class='c015'><sup>[1210]</sup></a>. In one of
them he declares, that his only Delight was to read the Scriptures;
and that all other Books, however well written, gave him rather
Disgust than Pleasure. <i>Jerom</i> returned to <i>Rome</i> from the East in 382.
with <i>Epiphanius</i> Bishop of <i>Salamis</i>, and <i>Paulinus</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, to
assist at the Council held there. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Jerom <i>kept at</i> Rome,<br/><i>and employed by him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The other Two returned to their
Sees; but <i>Jerom</i> continued at <i>Rome</i>, being kept there by <i>Damasus</i>,
who employed him in answering the Letters he received from the
Councils of several Churches applying to him for his Advice<a id='r1211' /><a href='#f1211' class='c015'><sup>[1211]</sup></a>. <i>Damasus</i>,
taken with his Learning and Erudition, and chiefly with the
Knowlege he had of the Scripture, had long before lived in great Intimacy
with him, and upon his leaving <i>Rome</i> writ frequent Letters to
him, not thinking it beneath the Rank he held in the Church to consult
him as his Master about the true Meaning of some difficult Passages
in holy Writ<a id='r1212' /><a href='#f1212' class='c015'><sup>[1212]</sup></a>. Thus in one of his Letters he desires him to explain
the Parable of the Prodigal Son<a id='r1213' /><a href='#f1213' class='c015'><sup>[1213]</sup></a>, and in another to interpret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the Word <i>Hosanna</i>, which he says was differently interpreted by different
Writers, who seemed to contradict each other<a id='r1214' /><a href='#f1214' class='c015'><sup>[1214]</sup></a>. In Compliance
with this Request, <i>Jerom</i> writ the Piece on that Subject, which
is still extant. It was likewise at the Desire of <i>Damasus</i> that he corrected
the <i>Latin</i> Version of the New Testament, and revised at <i>Rome</i>
the <i>Latin</i> Version of the Psalms, comparing it with the <i>Greek</i> Text
of the <i>Septuagint</i>. But as to the Letter, with which <i>Damasus</i> is supposed
to have encouraged him to undertake that Work, it is evidently
supposititious, and altogether unworthy of him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Psalmody falsly as-<br/>cribed to him.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><i>Anastasius</i> ascribes to <i>Damasus</i> the Custom of Singing, instead of
Reading, the Psalms at Divine Service<a id='r1215' /><a href='#f1215' class='c015'><sup>[1215]</sup></a>. But it is manifest from
<i>Austin</i>, that this Practice was brought from the East, and first complied
with by the Church of <i>Milan</i><a id='r1216' /><a href='#f1216' class='c015'><sup>[1216]</sup></a>, in the Year 386. that is, Two Years
after the Death of <i>Damasus</i>. So long as <i>Damasus</i> lived, <i>Jerom</i> continued
at <i>Rome</i>; but as, by his Learning and exemplary Life, he was
an Eye-sore to the lewd, ignorant, and haughty Clergy of <i>Rome</i>, or
as he styles them, <i>the Senate of Pharisees</i><a id='r1217' /><a href='#f1217' class='c015'><sup>[1217]</sup></a>, he thought it adviseable
to abandon the City upon the Death of his great Friend and Protector,
and retire to <i>Jerusalem</i>, hoping to find there that Quiet and Tranquillity
which he despaired of being able to enjoy while he dwelt with <i>the
Scarlet Whore</i><a id='r1218' /><a href='#f1218' class='c015'><sup>[1218]</sup></a>, that is, while he lived at <i>Rome</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Character.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As for the Character
of <i>Damasus</i>; <i>Jerom</i> styles him, <i>a Virgin Doctor of the Virgin
Church</i>; and, in his Letter to <i>Eustochium</i>, <i>a Man of great Excellence</i>.
<i>Theodoret</i> commends him as a Man of a holy Life, as one who
declined no Fatigue or Labour to support and maintain the Doctrine
of the Apostles, and who struck the <i>Arians</i> with Terror, though he
attacked them at a Distance<a id='r1219' /><a href='#f1219' class='c015'><sup>[1219]</sup></a>. Elsewhere he calls him the <i>famous Damasus</i><a id='r1220' /><a href='#f1220' class='c015'><sup>[1220]</sup></a>,
and places him at the Head of the most celebrated Teachers of
Truth, who, till his Time, had appeared in the West<a id='r1221' /><a href='#f1221' class='c015'><sup>[1221]</sup></a>. That <i>Greek</i>
Writer could not be biassed in his Favour, though <i>Jerom</i> perhaps was.
The Orientals declared, in 431. that they followed the Example of
<i>Damasus</i>, and other Persons eminent for Learning<a id='r1222' /><a href='#f1222' class='c015'><sup>[1222]</sup></a>; and the
Council of <i>Chalcedon</i>, speaking of his Letter to <i>Paulinus</i> of <i>Antioch</i>,
styles him the Honour and Glory of <i>Rome</i> for Piety and Justice<a id='r1223' /><a href='#f1223' class='c015'><sup>[1223]</sup></a>.
The Church of <i>Rome</i> honours him as a Saint, and his Festival is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>kept in some Places on the 10th, in others on the 11th of <i>December</i>.
But, after all, that he got the Pontificate by the most horrible Violence
and Bloodshed; that he lived in great State; that he had frequent and
grand Entertainments; that he kept a Table, which, in Sumptuousness,
vied with the Tables of the Emperors themselves; and all this
at the Expence of the <i>Roman</i> Ladies, whose generous Contributions
might have been applied to better Uses; is affirmed by contemporary
and unexceptionable Writers. It is likewise manifest from the Letters
of <i>Jerom</i>, that in his Time the Discipline of the Church was greatly
relaxed; that the Observance of the primitive Canons was almost
utterly neglected; and that Luxury, Ignorance, and Debauchery, universally
prevailed among the Ecclesiastics at <i>Rome</i>. And this Charge
against his Clergy in some degree recoils upon him, since he appears
to have carried the Papal Authority farther than any of his Predecessors,
and therefore might have restrained and corrected them. Whether
his Sanctity may not from all this be justly questioned, notwithstanding
the favourable Testimony of some antient Writers, I leave
the Reader to judge.</p>

we read in the Chronicle of <i>Prosper</i>. <i>Anastasius</i>
therefore, and the Author of the
Pontifical published by <i>Bollandus</i>, as well
as <i>Baronius</i>, were certainly mistaken in
affirming, upon what Grounds I know not,
that, upon the Death of <i>Damasus</i>, the See
remained vacant for the Space of 31 or 36

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Answer to</i><br/>Himerius <i>Bishop<br/>of</i> Tarragon.</div>

<p class='c001'>The first Thing I read of <i>Syricius</i> is his answering a Letter or Relation
which <i>Himerius</i>, Bishop of <i>Tarragon</i> in <i>Spain</i>, had sent to
<i>Damasus</i> by <i>Bassianus</i>, a Presbyter of that Church, requiring the Advice
of the Church of <i>Rome</i> concerning some Points of Discipline,
and certain Abuses that prevailed in <i>Spain</i>. <i>Damasus</i> being dead before
the Arrival of <i>Bassianus</i>, <i>Syricius</i>, who had succeeded him,
caused this Relation or Letter to be read, and carefully examined, in
an Assembly of his Brethren, that is, perhaps, of the Bishops who
had assisted at his Ordination; and, having maturely weighed and considered
every Article, he first acquainted <i>Himerius</i> with his Promotion,
and then returned to each the following Answers<a id='r1227' /><a href='#f1227' class='c015'><sup>[1227]</sup></a>. The First
was concerning the Sacrament of Baptism, which was by some Bishops
of <i>Spain</i> rejected as null and invalid, when conferred by an <i>Arian</i>
Minister. In Opposition to them, <i>Syricius</i> alleges the Authority of
<i>Liberius</i>, and of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, the Practice of the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, and that of all other Churches both in the East and West<a id='r1228' /><a href='#f1228' class='c015'><sup>[1228]</sup></a>.
<i>Isidorus</i> of <i>Seville</i> takes particular notice of this Point of Discipline,
which he says was established by the Letter of <i>Syricius</i><a id='r1229' /><a href='#f1229' class='c015'><sup>[1229]</sup></a>. By the Second
Article he forbids the Sacrament of Baptism to be administred
at <i>Christmas</i>, or the <i>Epiphany</i>, on the Feasts of the Apostles or Martyrs,
or at any other Time but <i>Easter</i>, and during the <i>Pentecost</i> of
that Festival, meaning, in all Likelihood, all <i>Easter</i> time, or the Fifty
Days between <i>Easter</i> and <i>Pentecost</i>, or <i>Whitsuntide</i>; for such, adds
he, is the Practice of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, and of all other Churches.
From this Rule, however, he excepts Children, and all Persons, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>are any-ways in Danger<a id='r1230' /><a href='#f1230' class='c015'><sup>[1230]</sup></a>. By the Third Article, he forbids granting
the Grace of Reconciliation to Apostates, that is, forgiving and readmitting
them to the Communion of the Church, except at the
Point of Death<a id='r1231' /><a href='#f1231' class='c015'><sup>[1231]</sup></a>. By the Fourth, a Woman, who, being betrothed
to one Man, has received the Priest’s Blessing to marry him, is debarred
from marrying another. The Fifth Article commands all Persons,
who, being guilty of a Crime, have performed Penance for it, to
be treated as the Apostates, if they relapse into the same Crime; and
the Sixth, all religious Persons, whether Men or Women, guilty of
Fornication, to be dealt with in the same Manner, and, moreover, to
be excluded from partaking of the sacred Mysteries, that is, of the
Eucharist, except at the Point of Death<a id='r1232' /><a href='#f1232' class='c015'><sup>[1232]</sup></a>. How different is the present
Practice of the Church of <i>Rome</i> from that of the same Church in
the Fourth Century! which was perhaps even too severe.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Priests and Deacons obliged to observe Celibacy.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><i>Syricius</i>, by the Seventh Article of his Letter, obliges all Priests
and Deacons to observe Celibacy; and as some had not paid due Obedience
to that Command of the Church, he allows those who should
acknowlege their Fault, and plead Ignorance, to continue in their
Rank, though without Hopes of rising: but as for those who should
presume to defend this Abuse as lawful, he declares them deposed and
degraded from the Rank they held in the Church<a id='r1233' /><a href='#f1233' class='c015'><sup>[1233]</sup></a>: Pope <i>Innocent</i> I.
writing to <i>Exuperius</i> Bishop of <i>Toulouse</i>, quotes and transcribes great
Part of this Article<a id='r1234' /><a href='#f1234' class='c015'><sup>[1234]</sup></a>. The Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Articles
describe at length the Life which those ought to have led, who
are raised by the Clergy and People to the Episcopal Dignity, and the
Steps or Degrees by which they should ascend to it. They ought first
to have been Readers; at the Age of Thirty, Acolytes, Subdeacons,
and Deacons; Five Years after, Presbyters; and in that Degree they
were to continue Ten Years before they could be chosen Bishops.
Those who had been married to Two Wives, or to a Widow, are
absolutely excluded from ever sitting in the Episcopal See. Even the
Lectors are forbidden, on pain of Deposition, to marry twice, or to
marry a Widow<a id='r1235' /><a href='#f1235' class='c015'><sup>[1235]</sup></a>. These, and several other less important Regulations,
<i>Syricius</i> delivers as general Rules to be inviolably observed by
all Churches, often declaring, that those who do not readily comply
with them shall be separated from his Communion by the Sentence of
a Synod, and strictly injoining the chief Prelates of each Province to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>take care they be punctually observed within the Bounds of their
respective Jurisdictions, on Pain of being deposed, and treated as they
deserve. He therefore desires <i>Himerius</i> to notify his Letter, not only
to all the Bishops of his Diocese or Province, but likewise to those of
<i>Carthagena</i>, <i>Bætica</i>, <i>Lusitania</i>, <i>Galicia</i>, and to all the neighbouring
Bishops, meaning perhaps those of <i>Gaul</i>; for <i>Innocent</i> I. supposes
the Decrees of his Predecessor <i>Syricius</i> to be known to <i>Exuperius</i>
of <i>Toulouse</i><a id='r1236' /><a href='#f1236' class='c015'><sup>[1236]</sup></a>; and in all Likelihood they were so to others in
that Country.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Letter is the First of all the Decretals acknowleged, by the
Learned, to be genuine, and likewise the First in all the antient Collections
of the Canons of the <i>Latin</i> Church. It is quoted by <i>Innocent</i>
I. and <i>Isidore</i> of <i>Seville</i>, and is the only Letter of the many
ascribed to <i>Syricius</i>, that <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i> has inserted in his Collection.
It is to be found in Father <i>Quesnel</i>’s <i>Roman Code</i><a id='r1237' /><a href='#f1237' class='c015'><sup>[1237]</sup></a>; and
<i>Cresconius</i> quotes no other Decrees of <i>Syricius</i> but what are taken
from this Letter. It is dated the Third of the Ides of <i>February</i>, that
is, the Eleventh of that Month 385. <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Bauto</i> being Consuls<a id='rN21' /><a href='#fN21' class='c015'><sup>[N21]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN21'>N21</a>. The Jesuit <i>Papebrok</i> highly extols
this Letter<a id='rN21.1' /><a href='#fN21.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, but, at the same time, does
not think it quite pure and genuine, because
the Date, says he, has been added to
it; for the other Letters of <i>Syricius</i>, and
likewise those of his Predecessors, bear no
Date. But can we conclude from thence,
that they never had any? Some of the Letters
of <i>Innocent</i> I. are dated, and some without
a Date, and he admits both. The
Transcribers contented themselves, for the
most part, with copying the Body of the
Letter, and neglected the rest.  <i>Papebrok</i>
adds, that the Date ought to have been expressed
thus: <i>Arcadio Aug. et Bautone viro
clar. Conss.</i> and not <i>Arcadio et Bautone viris
clarissimis</i>, as it is in that Letter. But
might not this Mistake be owing to the
Ignorance of the Transcribers, who, finding,
in the Original, only the Two Letters,
<i>V. C.</i> which are to be met with in many
antient Writings, set down <i>viris clarissimis</i>,
instead of <i>viro clarissimo</i>? <i>Papebrok</i> must
have observed the same Mistake in the Letter,
which Pope <i>Innocent</i> I. writ to the
Council of <i>Milevum</i><a id='rN21.2' /><a href='#fN21.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and which he allows
to be altogether genuine. For Slips

no Piece ought to be condemned, or

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Celibacy of the Clergy first proposed in the Council of</i> Elvira.</div>

<p class='c001'>As Priests and Deacons are commanded, by the Seventh Article of
this Letter, to abstain from Marriage, and this is the first Opportunity
that has offered of mentioning the Celibacy of the Clergy, a
short Digression on such a material Point of Discipline in the Church
may not, perhaps, be unacceptable to the Reader. The laying of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>heavy Burdens on the Shoulders of the Clergy, a Burden too heavy
for most of them to bear, as Experience has shewn, was first moved
in the Council of <i>Elvira</i>, held about the Year 300. according to the
most probable Opinion; and, being warmly promoted by the celebrated
<i>Osius</i> of <i>Cordoua</i>, and <i>Felix</i> of <i>Acci</i>, now <i>Guadix</i> in <i>Andalusia</i>,
who presided at that Assembly, it passed into a Law; and all
Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Subdeacons, were commanded, on
Pain of Deposition; <i>to abstain from Wives; and the begetting of
Children</i>. These are the very Words of the 33d Canon of that Council<a id='r1238' /><a href='#f1238' class='c015'><sup>[1238]</sup></a>.
That, till this time, the Clergy were allowed to marry, even
in <i>Spain</i>, is manifest from the 65th Canon of the same Council, excluding
from the Communion of the Church, even at the Point of
Death, such Ecclesiastics, as, knowing their Wives to be guilty of
Adultery, should not, upon the first Notice of their Crime, immediately
turn them out of Doors<a id='r1239' /><a href='#f1239' class='c015'><sup>[1239]</sup></a>. How long the 33d Canon continued
in Vigour, is uncertain; nay, it may be questioned whether it
ever took place: if it ever did, it was out of Date, or at least not
generally observed by the <i>Spanish</i> Clergy, in the Time of <i>Syricius</i>, as
evidently appears from the Words of his Letter, or Answer to <i>Himerius</i>
of <i>Tarragon</i>. I said, by the <i>Spanish</i> Clergy, for no such Injunction
had yet been laid on the Ecclesiastics of any other Country
or Nation. About Fifteen Years after, was held the Council of <i>Ancyra</i>,
in which it was decreed, That <i>if any Deacon did not declare
at his Ordination, that he designed to marry, he ought not to be
allowed to marry after but might, if he made such a Declaration,
because, in that Case, the Bishop tacitly consented to it</i>. The Council
of <i>Neocæfarea</i>, which assembled soon after that of <i>Ancyra</i>, and
consisted, in great Part, of the same Bishops, commanded <i>such Presbyters
as married after their Ordination to be degraded</i>.  In the Year
325. was held the Council of <i>Nice</i>; and, in that great Assembly, it
was moved, perhaps by <i>Osius</i>, who acted a chief Part there, that
Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Subdeacons, should be debarred
from all Commerce with the Wives they had married before their
Ordination. But this Motion was warmly opposed by <i>Paphnutius</i>,
who had himself ever led a chaste and single Life, and was one of the
most eminent and illustrious Prelates, at that time, in the Church.
He represented, that the Burden they proposed laying on the Clergy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>was too heavy; that few had sufficient Strength to bear it; that the
Women, thus abandoned by their Husbands, would be exposed to
great Dangers; that Marriage was no Pollution, but, according to
St. <i>Paul</i>, commendable; that those therefore, who were not married,
when first admitted to the Sacerdotal Functions, should continue in
that State; and such as were, should continue to live with their
Wives.

<p class='c001'><i>The Advice of</i> Paphnutius <i>was applauded by the whole Assembly</i>,
add the above-mentioned Historians, <i>and the Point in Dispute was
left undecided</i>. In the Year 340. it was decreed, in the Council of
<i>Arles</i>, that, <i>no Man, incumbered with a Wife, should be admitted to
Holy Orders, unless he promised, with his Wife’s Approbation and
Consent, to abstain for ever from the conjugal Duty</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is all I can find in the antient Records concerning the Continence
or Celibacy of the Clergy, before the Time of <i>Syricius</i>.  And
hence it is manifest, that both <i>Crichtonæus</i> and <i>Melanchthon</i> were
greatly mistaken; the former in affirming, which many have done
after him, that Celibacy was first imposed upon the Clergy by <i>Syricius</i><a id='r1243' /><a href='#f1243' class='c015'><sup>[1243]</sup></a>;
and the latter by confidently asserting, that Celibacy was not

Popes, in Opposition to all Councils and Synods<a id='r1244' /><a href='#f1244' class='c015'><sup>[1244]</sup></a>. It must be owned,
however, that this Law was not so generally observed before the
Time of <i>Syricius</i>, as it was after.  For it was not long after his Time
before it became an established Point of Discipline in most of the
Western Churches, not in virtue of his Letter, or of those which his
Successors writ to the same Purpose, but because it was injoined
by the Synods of each particular Nation. Thus it was established in

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN23'>N23</a>. I cannot forbear taking notice here
of an inexcusable Mistake in the <i>Ecclesiastical
History of</i> England, <i>by</i> Nicolas Harpsfeld,
<i>Archdeacon of</i> Canterbury, a Work in
great Request abroad. That Writer tells
us, that <i>Restitutus</i> Bishop of <i>London</i> assisted
at the Council of <i>Arles</i>, and signed the
above-mentioned Canon, forbidding a Man
incumbered with a Wife to be admitted to
Orders, unless he promised, with her Consent,
to refrain from all Commerce with
her after his Ordination. He leaves us to
infer from thence, that this Canon was received
in <i>Britain</i><a id='rN23.1' /><a href='#fN23.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. But surely <i>Harpsfeld</i>
must never have seen either the Subscriptions,
or the Acts of that Council. Had
he seen the Subscriptions, he had hardly
omitted Two <i>British</i> Bishops out of Three.
For, besides the Name of <i>Restitutus</i>, I find
among the Subscriptions, the Names of
<i>Adelphus de colonia Londinensium</i>, that is,
as is commonly believed, of <i>Colchester</i>, and
of <i>Hibernus</i> of <i>Eboracum</i>, or <i>York</i>.  Had he
seen the Acts, he had never been guilty of
such a gross Mistake as to ascribe the above-mentioned
Canon to the Council of <i>Arles</i>,
at which <i>Restitutus</i> assisted, since that Council
was held against the <i>Donatists</i> of <i>Africa</i>,
in the Year 314. and not the least Mention
was made there of the Celibacy of the
Clergy<a id='rN23.2' /><a href='#fN23.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The Second Council of <i>Arles</i>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The present Practice of the Church of</i> Rome, <i>with respect to this Point</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>As to the present Practice and Doctrine of the Church of <i>Rome</i>,
with respect to this, in their Opinion, most essential Point of Ecclesiastical
Discipline, no Man is allowed, after his Ordination, to marry,
or to cohabit with the Wife he had married before: nay, in order to
prevent all possible means even of any clandestine Commerce between
them, the Woman must, by a solemn Vow of Chastity, renounce all
Claims on her Husband, and, retiring into a Monastery, bind herself
by a second Vow to continue there, without ever once going out,
on any Pretence whatsoever, so long as her Husband lives, who cannot
be admitted so much as to the Rank of a Subdeacon, till she is
secured by these <span class='sc'>Two Vows</span>. Such is the present Practice of the
Church of <i>Rome</i>, though Subdeacons were allowed to marry long
after the Time of <i>Syricius</i>, who, in his Letter, mentions only Deacons
and Presbyters, and does not even oblige them to part with their
Wives, but only excludes them from rising to a higher Degree in
the Church.  Pope <i>Leo the Great</i>, chosen in 440. was the first who
extended the Law of Celibacy to the Subdeacons, commanding them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>in a Letter, which he writ about the Year 442. to <i>Rusticus</i> Bishop
of <i>Narbonne</i>, to abstain, as well as the Deacons, Presbyters, and Bishops,
from all Commerce with their Wives. But this Law was observed
by very few Churches. In the Time of Pope <i>Gregory the
Great</i>, that is, in the Latter-end of the Sixth Century, it had not
yet taken place, even in <i>Sicily</i>, though reckoned among the <i>Suburbicarian</i>
Provinces: it was first introduced into that Island by him;
but he allowed those to cohabit with their Wives, who had been ordained
without a previous Promise to live continent, though he would
not suffer them to be raised to a higher Degree without such a Promise.
<i>Bellarmine</i><a id='r1245' /><a href='#f1245' class='c015'><sup>[1245]</sup></a>, and the other Divines of the Church of <i>Rome</i>,
to soften the Odium, which the hard, and commonly impracticable
Command she lays on her Clergy, must reflect on her, represent Continency
as a Virtue to be easily acquired. Their Ascetics seem better
acquainted with the Difficulties and Struggles attending the Practice
of that Virtue, than their Divines; for they prescribe, as the sole
Means of attaining it, constant Prayer, frequent Fasting, macerating
the rebelling Flesh with all kinds of Austerities, and principally the
avoiding of all Female Company. And, if these be the sole Means
of attaining it, I leave the Reader to judge how few of their Clergy
do attain it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>In the primitive<br/>Church, married and<br/>unmarried Men<br/>raised indiscrimin-<br/>ately to Ecclesiastical<br/>Dignities.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>No one is so little versed in the History of the Church, as not to
know, that in the Three first Centuries of the Christian Religion,
married and unmarried Men were indiscriminately raised to the Episcopal,
and every other Ecclesiastical Dignity; nay, <i>Jerom</i> writes,
that in his Time, that is, in the Fourth Century, the former were,
the most part, preferred to the latter, not in regard of their greater
Merit, but because, in such Elections, the unmarried Men were outnumbered
by the married, who chose to be governed by one in their
own Station of Life<a id='r1246' /><a href='#f1246' class='c015'><sup>[1246]</sup></a>. It is hence manifest, that Marriage was not
thought, in <i>Jerom</i>’s Time, inconsistent with, or any Bar to, the Episcopal
Dignity. And why should it? since, excepting St. <i>John</i>, the
Apostles themselves were all married, as we are told, in express
Terms, by <i>Ignatius</i> the Martyr<a id='r1247' /><a href='#f1247' class='c015'><sup>[1247]</sup></a>, who was their Contemporary and
Disciple, and whose Authority ought, on that Consideration, to be
of greater Weight than that of all the other Fathers together. <i>But
such of the primitive Clergy</i>, says <i>Bellarmine</i><a id='r1248' /><a href='#f1248' class='c015'><sup>[1248]</sup></a>, <i>as were married before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>their Ordination, abstained ever after from the Use of Matrimony:
let our Adversaries produce, if they can, but a single Evidence
of a Presbyter or Bishop’s having any Commerce with their Wives</i>.
It lies upon him to shew they had not. We know nothing to the
contrary, and therefore may well suppose, that, pursuant to the Advice
given by the Apostle to all Husbands and Wives, <i>they came

them for their Incontinency</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Celibacy recom-<br/>mended by the Fathers</i>:</div>

<p class='c001'>The Fathers, it is true, out of a mistaken Notion of an extraordinary
Merit attending Celibacy in this Life, and an extraordinary Reward
reserved for it in the other, began very early to recommend it
to Persons of all Ranks and Stations, but more especially to the
Clergy, as the principal Excellence and Perfection of a Christian. By
their Exhortations, and the Praises they were constantly bestowing
on Virginity, Celibacy, and Continence, many among the Clergy,
and even some of the Laity, were wrought up to such a Pitch of Enthusiasm,
as to mutilate themselves, thinking they could by no other
means be sufficiently qualified for the unnatural, but meritorious, State
of Celibacy. And, what is very surprising, this Practice became so
common in the End of the Third, and the Beginning of the Fourth,
Century, that the Fathers of <i>Nice</i> were obliged to restrain it by a particular
Canon. They enacted one accordingly, excluding for ever
from the Priesthood, such <i>as should make themselves Eunuchs, the
Preservation of their Life or Health not requiring such a Mutilation</i>.
By the same Canon they deposed and degraded all, who should
thus maim themselves after their Ordination<a id='r1249' /><a href='#f1249' class='c015'><sup>[1249]</sup></a>. But tho’ the Fathers
warmly recommended Celibacy to the unmarried Clergy, and Continence
to the Married, neither was looked upon as an Obligation,
till late in the Fourth Century, and not even then in all Places; for
<i>Epiphanius</i>, who lived till the Beginning of the Fifth, writes, that
though <i>Men still begetting Children</i> were excluded by the Ecclesiastical
Canons from every Dignity and Degree in the Church, yet
they were in some Places admitted as Subdeacons, Deacons, and
Presbyters, because those Canons were not yet universally observed<a id='r1250' /><a href='#f1250' class='c015'><sup>[1250]</sup></a>;
so that, according to <i>Epiphanius</i>, it was not by the Apostles <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>never injoined by<br/>the Apostles</i>:<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  (as the
Divines of the Church of <i>Rome</i> pretend), but by the Ecclesiastical
Canons, that this Obligation was laid on the Clergy; and, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Time, those Canons were not yet universally complied with, nor
indeed many Ages after: nay, in the <i>Greek</i> Church, the Clergy are
to this Day allowed to cohabit with the Wives they married before
their Ordination; and, in this Kingdom, Celibacy was not universally
established till after the Conquest, as I shall have Occasion to shew
in the Sequel of the present History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>deemed by Pagans the highest Degree of Sanctity</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The abstaining from lawful, as well as unlawful Pleasures, was
deemed, by the antient Pagans, especially in the East, the highest Degree
of Sanctity and Perfection. Hence some of their Priests, in Compliance
with this Notion, and to recommend themselves to the Esteem
of the People, did not only profess, promise, and vow an eternal Abstinence
from all Pleasures of that Nature, as those of the Church of
<i>Rome</i> do, but put it out of their Power ever to enjoy them. Thus
the Priests of <i>Cybele by becoming Priests ceased to be Men</i>, to borrow
the Expression of <i>Jerom</i>; and the <i>Hierophantes</i>, who were the
first Ministers of Religion among the <i>Athenians</i>, rendered themselves
equally incapable of transgressing the Vows they had made, by constantly
drinking the cold Juice of Hemlock<a id='r1251' /><a href='#f1251' class='c015'><sup>[1251]</sup></a>. A <i>Stoic</i>, called <i>Cheremon</i>,
introduced by <i>Jerom</i> to describe the Lives of the <i>Egyptian</i>
Priests, tells us, among other things, that, from the time they addicted
themselves to the Service of the Gods, they renounced all Intercourse
and Commerce with Women; and, the better to conquer
their natural Inclinations, abstained altogether from Meat and Wine.
Several other Instances might be alleged to shew, that Celibacy was
embraced and practised by the Pagan Priests, long before the Birth
of the Christian Religion; and, consequently, that it was not Religion,
but Superstition, that first laid the Priesthood under such an
Obligation. The Church of <i>Rome</i> has borrowed, as is notorious,
several Ceremonies, Customs, and Practices of the Pagans, and perhaps
the Celibacy of the Priesthood among the rest: I say, <i>perhaps</i>,
because it might have been suggested to her by the same Spirit of Superstition
that suggested it to them: for where-ever the same Spirit
prevails, it will ever operate in the same manner, and be attended
with the same, or the like Effects. Thus we find the same Austerities
practised by the Pagans in the <i>East-Indies</i>, and other idolatrous Nations,
that are practised and recommended by the Church of <i>Rome</i>;
and yet no Man can imagine those Austerities to have been by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>either borrowed of the other. There is almost an intire Conformity
between the Laws, Discipline, and Hierarchy of the antient
<i>Druids</i>, and the present <i>Roman-Catholic</i> Clergy; nay, the latter
claim the very same Privileges, Prerogatives, and Exemptions, as
were claimed and enjoyed by the former<a id='r1252' /><a href='#f1252' class='c015'><sup>[1252]</sup></a>: and yet we cannot well
suppose them to have been guided therein by their Example. Celibacy
was discountenanced by the <i>Romans</i>, who nevertheless had their
<i>Vestals</i>, instituted by their Second King at a time when, the new
City being yet thinly inhabited, Marriage ought in both Sexes to have
been most encouraged: and the same Spirit, which suggested to that
superstitious Prince the Institution of the <i>Vestals</i>, suggested the like
Institutions to other Pagan Nations, and to the Church of <i>Rome</i> that
of so many different Orders of Nuns.</p>

<p class='c001'>How much better had the Church of <i>Rome</i> consulted her own Reputation,
had she either, in Opposition to the Pagan Priesthood, allowed
her Clergy the Use of Matrimony, or, by a more perfect Imitation
of their Discipline, with the Law of Celibacy, prescribed the
like Methods of observing it! How many Enormities had been prevented
by either of these Means, the World knows. But none of her
Clergy have the Observance of their Vows so much at Heart as to imitate
either the <i>Athenian</i> or the <i>Egyptian</i> Priests: and as for those of
<i>Cybele</i>, they are so far from conforming to their Practice, that a Law
subjecting them to it has kept them out of Protestant Kingdoms, when
the Fear of Death could not.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Celibacy of the Clergy a bad Institution.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>If every Law or Institution is to be judged good or evil, according
to the Good and Evil attending them, it is by daily Experience but too
manifest, that the forced Celibacy of the Clergy ought to be deemed
of all Institutions the very worst. Indeed all sensible Men of that
Church know and lament the innumerable Evils which the Celibacy
of her Clergy occasions, and must always occasion, in spite of all
Remedies that can be applied to it. But she finds one Advantage in
it, which, in her Eyes, makes more than sufficient Amends for all
those Evils, <i>viz.</i> her ingrossing by that means to herself all the
Thoughts and Attention of her Clergy, which, were they allowed
to marry, would be divided between her and their Families, and each
of them would have a separate Interest from that of the Church.
Several Customs and Practices, once warmly espoused by that Church,
have, in Process of Time, been abrogated, and quite laid aside, on account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of the Inconveniences attending them; and this, which long Experience
has shewn to be attended with more pernicious Consequences
than any other, had, but for that political View, been likewise abolished.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Another Letter of</i> Syricius.</div>

<p class='c001'>Another Letter, universally ascribed to <i>Syricius</i>, has reached our
Times. It is written in a very perplexed and obscure Style; bears no
Date; is not to be found either in <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i>, or any antient
Code; and is addressed to <i>all the Orthodox dwelling in different Provinces</i><a id='r1253' /><a href='#f1253' class='c015'><sup>[1253]</sup></a>:
which is manifestly a Mistake, since <i>Syricius</i> desires those, to
whom it is addressed, to confirm it with their Subscriptions, which
cannot be understood but of <i>Bishops</i>. However, as it is received by
all as genuine, I shall not take upon me to reject it as spurious. The
Subject of this Letter is the Ordination of the Ministers of the Church;
and the First Article is against those who pretend to pass from the Vanities
of the World to the Episcopal Dignity. <i>Syricius</i> writes, that
they came often to him, attended with numerous Retinues, begging
him to ordain them; but that they had never been able to prevail
upon him to grant them their Request. In the Second Article he
complains of the Monks, who were constantly wandering about the
Country, and on whom the Bishops chose rather to confer holy Orders,
and the Episcopal Dignity itself, than to relieve them with Alms.
The Third and last Article forbids a Layman or Neophyte to be ordained
either Deacon or Presbyter. If this Letter be genuine, <i>Syricius</i>
was the first Bishop of <i>Rome</i> who styled himself <i>Pope</i>, as <i>Papebrok</i>
well observes<a id='r1254' /><a href='#f1254' class='c015'><sup>[1254]</sup></a>; for the Title of his Letter, as transmitted to us,
runs thus; <i>Pope Syricius to the Orthodox</i>, &amp;c. The Word imports
no more than Father, and it was antiently given, out of Respect, to
all Bishops, as I have observed elsewhere; but I have found none
before <i>Syricius</i> who distinguished themselves with that Title.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerom <i>retires from</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Jerom</i> continued at <i>Rome</i> some Months after the Death of his great
Patron <i>Damasus</i>. But, finding himself obnoxious to the <i>Roman</i>
Clergy, for the Liberty he had taken in some of his Writings to censure
their effeminate and licentious Lives, and, on the other hand, not
being countenanced and supported by <i>Syricius</i>, as he had been by his
Predecessor, he thought it adviseable to abandon that City, and return
to <i>Palæstine</i>. Some pretend, but without sufficient Authority, that
<i>Syricius</i> joined the rest in reviling and persecuting him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Usurper</i> Maximus <i>writs to</i> Syricius.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span><i>Baronius</i> has inserted, in his Annals<a id='r1255' /><a href='#f1255' class='c015'><sup>[1255]</sup></a>, a Letter from the Usurper
<i>Maximus</i>, who reigned in <i>Gaul</i>; from which we learn, that <i>Syricius</i>
had writ first to him, exhorting him to continue steady in the Catholic
Faith, being, perhaps, apprehensive lest he should suffer himself
to be imposed upon by the <i>Priscillianists</i>, who were very numerous in
<i>Gaul</i>; and complaining to him of the undue Ordination of a Presbyter
named <i>Agricius</i>. <i>Maximus</i>, in his Answer, pretends great
Zeal for the true Faith, and promises to assemble the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>,
and of the Five Provinces, meaning <i>Gallia Narbonensis</i>, to examine
the Affair of <i>Agricius</i>. He assures <i>Syricius</i>, that he has nothing so
much at Heart as to maintain the Catholic Faith pure and uncorrupted;
to see a perfect Harmony established among the Prelates of the Church,
and to suppress the many Disorders which had prevailed at the Time
of his Accession to the Empire, and would have soon proved incurable,
had they been neglected. He adds, that many shocking Abominations
of the <i>Manichees</i>, meaning no doubt the <i>Priscillianists</i>, had
been discovered, not by groundless Conjectures and Surmises, but by
their own Confession before the Magistrates, as <i>Syricius</i> might learn
from the Acts. For <i>Maximus</i> caused the Ringleaders of that Sect to
be put to Death this very Year, convicted before the Magistrates of
the grossest Immoralities<a id='rN24' /><a href='#fN24' class='c015'><sup>[N24]</sup></a>. These were <i>Priscillian</i> himself, <i>Felicissimus</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>and <i>Armenus</i>, Two Ecclesiastics, who had but very lately
embraced his Doctrine; <i>Asarinus</i> and <i>Aurelius</i>, Two Deacons; <i>Latronianus</i>,
or, as <i>Jerom</i> calls him, <i>Matronianus</i>, a Layman; and <i>Enchrocia</i>,
the Widow of the Orator <i>Delphidius</i>, who had professed
Eloquence in the City of <i>Bourdeaux</i> a few Years before. These were,
by the Order of <i>Maximus</i>, all beheaded this Year at <i>Treves</i>. The rest
of <i>Priscillian</i>’s Followers, whom they could discover and apprehend,
were either banished or confined.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN24'>N24</a>. The first Author of this Sect was
one <i>Mark</i>, a Native of <i>Memphis</i> in <i>Egypt</i>,
a famous Magician, and once a Follower
of the Doctrine of the <i>Manichees</i><a id='rN24.1' /><a href='#fN24.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. From
<i>Egypt</i> he travelled into <i>Spain</i>, where he
had for his Disciples a Woman of Quality
named <i>Agapa</i>, <i>Elpidius</i> the Rhetorician,
and <i>Agagius</i><a id='rN24.2' /><a href='#fN24.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. <i>Priscillian</i>, of whom I
shall speak hereafter, was the Disciple and
Successor of the Two latter. <i>Jerom</i> tells us,
upon the Authority of <i>Irenæus</i>, whom he
quotes, that <i>Mark</i> passed from the Banks
of the <i>Rhone</i> into <i>Aquitaine</i>,and from thence
into <i>Spain</i><a id='rN24.3' /><a href='#fN24.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>; which made <i>Baronius</i> write,
that he first infected <i>Gaul</i><a id='rN24.4' /><a href='#fN24.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>. But no such
thing was ever affirmed by <i>Irenæus</i>; and
besides, <i>Jerom</i> confounds the Sect of the
<i>Marcosians</i> with that of the <i>Priscillianists</i>,
and the Author of the former, who was
contemporary with <i>Irenæus</i>, with the Author
of the latter, who lived in the Fourth
Century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <i>Priscillianists</i> broached no new
Doctrine, but formed a new Sect, by adopting
every impious Opinion that had
been broached by others; whence their
Sect is styled by <i>Austin</i>, the common Sink
of all other Heresies<a id='rN24.5' /><a href='#fN24.5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. By their external
Behaviour, which was extremely modest
and composed, they gained many Followers,
whom, by degrees, they let into
the Abominations of their Sect; for there
was no Lewdness which they did not encourage
and practise, rejecting Matrimony
for no other Reason, but because it confined
a Man to one Woman, and a Woman
 to one Man<a id='rN24.6' /><a href='#fN24.6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>. They held it no
Crime to speak contrary to what they
thought and believed, and to confirm with
an Oath what they said when they were
talking to People of a different Persuasion.
This was one of their favourite Maxims,
which above all others they took care to
inculcate to their Proselytes, often repeating
to them, and among themselves, the
famous Verse;</p>

<p class='c020'>Hence it was no easy Matter to discover
them; for they mixed with the Orthodox
at Divine Service, received the Sacraments
of the Church, and disowned, with the
most solemn Oaths, the Doctrine which
they had been heard by many to utter and
teach<a id='rN24.8' /><a href='#fN24.8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. To this Sect <i>Priscillian</i>, who

<i>Elpidius</i> and <i>Agagius</i>. He was
a Man of Birth and Fortune, being descended
of an antient and illustrious Family
in <i>Spain</i>, and is said to have been endowed
with extraordinary Parts, and well
versed in every Branch of Learning; so

were several Persons of the first
Rank, both Men and Women, and even
some Bishops, namely, <i>Vegetinus</i>, <i>Symphosius</i>,
<i>Instantius</i>, and <i>Salvianus</i>, of whom
the Two latter entered into an indissoluble

<i>Rome</i>’s universal Jurisdiction; and, secondly, that the Bishop of <i>Milan</i>
did not act, as <i>Baronius</i> pretends, on that Occasion as the Pope’s Legate.
Their requiring the Approbation of the Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, besides
that of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, sufficiently proves the one; and
their requiring the Approbation of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, besides that
of the Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Four other Bishops, <i>viz.</i> <i>Herenius</i>, <i>Donatus</i>, <i>Acurius</i>, and <i>Æmilius</i>,
could by no means be induced to follow the Example of <i>Symphosius</i>
and <i>Dictinius</i>; and were thereupon deposed by the Council,
and cut off from the Communion of the Catholic Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Acts of that<br/>Council confirmed by<br/>St.</i> Ambrose <i>and</i><br/>Syricius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Bishops
of <i>Rome</i> and <i>Milan</i> not only confirmed the Acts of the Council
with respect to <i>Symphosius</i> and <i>Dictinius</i>, but separated themselves
from the Communion of the Bishops of <i>Bætica</i> and the <i>Carthagenese</i>,
who, thinking the Council had dealt too favourably with them, refused
to admit them to their Communion<a id='r1260' /><a href='#f1260' class='c015'><sup>[1260]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Dictinius <i>honoured as<br/>a Saint</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Dictinius</i> died in 420.
and is now honoured in <i>Spain</i> as a Saint, though it may be justly questioned
whether he deserves that Honour. <i>Idatius</i> the Chronologist
who was a Native of <i>Spain</i>, and raised there to the Episcopal Dignity
about the Year 428. mentions him without saying any thing in
his Praise, or taking the least Notice of his being honoured then as
a Saint. St. <i>Austin</i> speaks doubtfully even of his Conversion<a id='r1261' /><a href='#f1261' class='c015'><sup>[1261]</sup></a>, and
at the same time tells us, that his Book was highly esteemed by the
<i>Priscillianists</i>, and his Memory no less revered; which, notwithstanding
the eminent Sanctity ascribed to him by <i>Baronius</i><a id='r1262' /><a href='#f1262' class='c015'><sup>[1262]</sup></a>, gives
us room to suspect, that the Honour now paid him is owing to a Tradition
handed down by the <i>Priscillianists</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Priscillian <i>honoured<br/>as a Saint and a<br/>Martyr</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For thus was <i>Priscillian</i>
himself once revered both as a Saint and a Martyr. Nay, the Author
of the Notes on <i>Sulpitius Severus</i> assures us, that he has seen his
Name in some, not very antient, Martyrologies; and <i>Petrus de Natalibus</i>
has allowed, both to him, and to <i>Latronianus</i>, who suffered
with him, a Place among the Martyrs of the Church, pretending to
be countenanced therein by the Authority of <i>Jerom</i><a id='r1263' /><a href='#f1263' class='c015'><sup>[1263]</sup></a>. And truly it
must be owned, that <i>Jerom</i>, in the Year 392. writ very favourably
of <i>Priscillian</i>. <i>He was executed</i>, says he, <i>by the Faction of</i> Ithacius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span><i>being accused by some as if he had embraced the Heresy of the</i> Gnostics;
<i>but others maintained, that he held not the Doctrine and Tenets
with which he was charged</i><a id='r1264' /><a href='#f1264' class='c015'><sup>[1264]</sup></a>. But being afterwards better informed,
he styles him <i>an execrable Man</i><a id='r1265' /><a href='#f1265' class='c015'><sup>[1265]</sup></a>, and condemns his Doctrine as an
<i>infamous Heresy</i>, as a <i>Plague</i> and <i>Contagion</i>, that cruelly ravaged
most of the <i>Spanish</i> Provinces<a id='r1266' /><a href='#f1266' class='c015'><sup>[1266]</sup></a>. It is not therefore without Reason
that the Church of <i>Rome</i> now anathematizes, as an Heretic, the Man
she once revered as a Saint. Such has been the Fate of many others,
judged by <i>Baronius</i> himself unworthy of the Worship that was paid
them, and therefore set aside, when, by the Command of <i>Gregory</i> XIII.
he revised and corrected the <i>Roman Martyrology</i>. As for <i>Dictinius</i>,
he has not yet been driven out of Heaven, though nobody can well
tell how he came in. 'Tis true, both he and <i>Symphosius</i> are styled
<i>Bishops of holy Memory</i>, in the Abstract of the Council of <i>Toledo</i>,
which is supposed to have been done about the Year 447. This is all
<i>Baronius</i> can plead in favour of his <i>eminent Sanctity</i>. A poor Charter
indeed to hold a Place in Heaven by, and claim the Worship and Honours
attending it! For the Author of that Abstract is utterly unknown;
and, besides, he canonizes alike <i>Symphosius</i> and <i>Dictinius</i>,
styling them both Bishops of holy Memory. Why then should his
Authority have so much Weight with respect to the one, and none at
all in regard of the other? If we bar Prescription, which surely can have
no room here, <i>Dictinius</i> can have no more Right to keep the Place he
has, than <i>Symphosius</i> to claim the Place he has not. Nay, the latter would
have a far better Right, were it true, that <i>Dictinius</i> relapsed into the
Errors he had abjured, and was on that Account deposed with several
other Bishops of his Sect. This I read in an Author of great Note<a id='r1267' /><a href='#f1267' class='c015'><sup>[1267]</sup></a>;
but as he advances it upon the Authority of another, <i>viz.</i> of <i>Idatius</i>
the Chronologist, and the Passage he quotes is not to be found in that
Writer, at least in the Editions I have perused, it would be both unjust
and ungenerous to deprive <i>Dictinius</i> of, or disturb him in, the
Possession of his Saintship upon such an Evidence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Doctrine of the</i><br/>Priscillianists <i>takes<br/>deep Root in</i> Spain.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Syricius</i> and <i>Ambrose</i>, in Conjunction with the Catholic Bishops
of <i>Spain</i>,  alarmed at the wonderful Progress the Doctrine of <i>Priscillian</i>
had made in so short a Time, left nothing unattempted they
could think of to put a Stop to the growing Evil. But all to no Purpose;
in spite of their utmost Efforts, in defiance of the most severe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Laws, that were enacted against them, especially by the Emperors
<i>Honorius</i>, and <i>Theodosius</i> the younger, their Numbers increased daily,
and their Doctrine grew daily more popular; the Severities that were
practised against them, serving only to recommend those to the Esteem
and Veneration of the Multitude, who suffered them, as many did,
with Patience and Constancy. As they held it lawful to conceal their
real Sentiments from the Catholics, by disowning them with the
most solemn Oaths; the Catholics suffered themselves to be led by a
mistaken Zeal into the same Error, disowning, in like manner, their
Sentiments, the better to discover those of their Adversaries. But
this pernicious Practice of <i>defending Truth by destroying it, and opposing
Lyes by Lying</i>, was fully and unanswerably confuted by <i>Austin</i>,
in his Answer to <i>Consentius</i>, who had writ to him at Length upon
that Subject<a id='r1268' /><a href='#f1268' class='c015'><sup>[1268]</sup></a><a id='rN27' /><a href='#fN27' class='c015'><sup>[N27]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN27'>N27</a>. The Doctrine of the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, concerning Equivocations, mental
Reservations, and the Lawfulness, or rather
Obligation, of concealing, with the most
solemn Oaths, what has been revealed under
the Seal of Confession, has perhaps some
Affinity with the Doctrine of the <i>Priscillianists</i>.
What is only known under the
Seal of Confession, say their Divines, is
not known to Man, but to God alone,
since it was not discovered to a Man, but
to God represented by a Man, that is, to
the Priest or Confessor; and therefore the
Priest may, with a safe Conscience, affirm,
even upon Oath, that he knows not what
he thus knew. 'Tis by recurring to this
Doctrine, that F. <i>Daniel Bartoli</i>, in his
<i>History of</i> England, or rather of the <i>Jesuits</i>
in <i>England</i>, endeavours to justify the Conduct
of the <i>Jesuit Garnet</i>, in not discovering
the <i>Gun-powder Plot</i>, to which he supposes
him to have been privy: but as it
was disclosed to him in Confession, or at
least under the Seal of Confession, he had
sinned grievously by discovering it, though
by such a Discovery he might have saved a
whole Nation from Destruction<a id='rN27.1' /><a href='#fN27.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. So
that the violating such a Seal is a far greater
Evil than the Loss of so many Lives, than
the utter Ruin of an intire Nation. A
Doctrine evidently repugnant to the Dictates
both of Reason and Humanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The indefatigable Pains <i>Syricius</i> took, together with the other Catholic
Bishops, in suppressing the Heresy of the <i>Priscillianists</i>, proved
quite unsuccessful, though seconded by the Secular Power, and the
severest Laws that had yet been enacted against Heretics. Their
Doctrine rather gained, than lost Ground; and we shall find them in
the Sixth Century, that is, Two hundred Years hence, still a numerous
Sect, and Councils assembling, to very little Purpose, against
them. <i>Syricius</i> was not so intent, as we are told, upon maintaining
the Doctrine of the Church, as to neglect the Discipline. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Council assembled by</i><br/>Syricius <i>at</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In order
to correct several Abuses, that had begun to prevail, and revive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>some antient Constitutions, that were grown out of Use, he convened
a Council at <i>Rome</i>, which is said to have consisted of Eighty
Bishops; and, with their Consent and Approbation, established the
following Canons: 1. That no one should presume to ordain a Bishop,
without the Knowlege of the <i>Apostolic See</i>. 2. That no Man
should be admitted to the Ecclesiastical Order, who, after the Remission
of his Sins, that is, perhaps, after his Baptism, had worn the
Sword of worldly Warfare. 3. That no Clerk should marry a Widow.
4. That the <i>Novatians</i> and <i>Montanists</i>, that is, <i>Donatists</i>,
should be received into the Church by the Imposition of Hands; but
that such as, abandoning the Catholic Faith, had been rebaptized by
them, should not be re-admitted without performing a long Penance.
5. That the Priests and Deacons should live continent, being, by their
Office, daily employed in the Divine Ministry<a id='r1269' /><a href='#f1269' class='c015'><sup>[1269]</sup></a>. These Canons or
Decrees, say the Roman Catholic Divines, are contained in a Letter,
which <i>Syricius</i> writ to the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, and which was read,
and received as a Law, by a Council held some Years after at <i>Tela</i>,
in the Province of <i>Byzacene</i>, as appears from the Acts of that Council<a id='r1270' /><a href='#f1270' class='c015'><sup>[1270]</sup></a>.
<i>Ferrandus</i>, Deacon of <i>Carthage</i>, in his Abridgment of the
Canons, done in the Sixth Century, often quotes the Letter of <i>Syricius</i>,
and takes particular Notice of the Canons that were copied from
it by the Council of <i>Tela</i>. The same Letter, together with the
Acts of that Council, are to be found, Word for Word, in the antient
Code of the Church of <i>Rome</i>. So that, upon the Whole, we
cannot question, says <i>Baronius</i>, the Authenticity of that Piece, without
rendering the Authority of every other Monument of Antiquity
quite precarious, and leaving Men to their own wild and groundless
Conjectures. But Men of Learning have, of late Years, been too
much upon their Guard to admit, without the strictest Examination,
any Piece, however authentic in Appearance, that seemed to countenance
the extraordinary Power and Authority claimed by the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>. And not without Reason, since they well knew what
Pains had been taken to banish Truth, by suppressing or adulterating
the most authentic Records, and to establish Falshood, by substituting
in their room fabulous Legends, spurious Letters, and Acts of Councils
that never were held. As for the Letter ascribed to <i>Syricius</i>, it
has been suspected ever since Criticism took place<a id='r1271' /><a href='#f1271' class='c015'><sup>[1271]</sup></a>, and lately rejected,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>as unquestionably supposititious, by F. <i>Quesnel</i>, who, in a
learned Dissertation on that Subject, proves, in my Opinion, unanswerably,
not only the Letter; but the Acts of the pretended Council
of <i>Tela</i>, to have been forged, and inserted, in latter Times, into the
Collection of <i>Ferrandus</i>, and the <i>Roman</i> Code<a id='r1272' /><a href='#f1272' class='c015'><sup>[1272]</sup></a><a id='rN28' /><a href='#fN28' class='c015'><sup>[N28]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fN28'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN28'>N28</a>. To convince the Reader of this
double Forgery, I need not refer him to
that judicious Writer. The many groundless,
perplexed, and contradictory Arguments,
or rather Conjectures, alleged by
those who have taken most Pains to prove
both the above-mentioned Pieces genuine,
<i>viz.</i> by <i>Chifflerus</i>, <i>Papebrok</i>, and Cardinal
<i>Noris</i>, are, perhaps, a more convincing
Proof of their being forged, than any that
can be alleged against them. There is so
palpable a Difference, in point of Style, between
this Letter, and that which <i>Syricius</i>
writ to <i>Himerius</i>, and which is on all
Hands allowed to be genuine, that no one
can possibly suppose both to have been
penned by one and the same Person. Besides,
in the former Letter <i>Syricius</i> absolutely
commands, and in this only advises,
exhorts, and intreats the Priests and Deacons
to live continent. Of those Two Difficulties
none of the Writers I have just
quoted have thought fit to take the least Notice,
though they could hardly escape their
Observation. The very first Canon or Article
of this Letter, for the sake of which
both the Letter itself, and the Acts of the
Council, were most probably forged, sufficiently
betrays the Forgery. For it is absolutely
unintelligible, and therefore pointed,
construed, altered, <i>&amp;c.</i> in Twenty different
Manners, by those who maintain it
to be genuine. Some read it thus: <i>Ut sine
conscientia sedis Apostolicæ Primatis nemo
audeat ordinare</i>; <i>That no one should presume
to ordain without the Knowlege of the Primate
of the Apostolic See</i>. I do not find the
Bishops of <i>Rome</i> to have ever styled themselves,
in their Letters, <i>Primates of the
Apostolic See</i>; nay, the humble Title of
<i>Primate of the Apostolic See</i> (humble with
respect to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, Primate,
Prince, and Monarch of the whole Church),
so soured <i>Labbé</i>, that he fairly owned the
Truth, chusing rather to give up the Letter,
than to admit a Title that seemed to
detract from the <i>Supremacy</i>. Besides, it is
very certain, that, in the Time of <i>Syricius</i>
the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> were not yet so lost
to all Modesty as to pretend, in open Defiance
of the Canons, that no Bishop should
be ordained without their Knowlege. Others
read that Article thus: <i>Ut extra conscientiam
sedis Apostolicæ, hoc est, Primatis</i>, &amp;c.
<i>That none should presume to ordain without
the Knowlege of the Apostolic See, that is, of
their Primate.</i> Now, is it probable, that
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> would have given the
Title of <i>Apostolic See</i> to all the Metropolitan
Churches; a Title which Pope <i>Leo
the Great</i> would not allow even to the Bishop
of <i>Constantinople</i><a id='rN28.1' /><a href='#fN28.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>? I might add,
that the Author of this Letter writes, and
I think very ridiculously, that the <i>African</i>
Bishops would have come to <i>Rome</i> to assist
at the Council, had they not been prevented
by their Infirmities, or old Age; which is
supposing them all to have been old or infirm;
that the Subscription of this Letter
is very singular, <i>Data Romæ in Concilio
Episcoporum octoginta</i>, which in all other
Synodal Letters is placed at the Beginning;
that neither this Letter, nor the Council
of <i>Tela</i>; by which it is supposed to have
been quoted, are ever mentioned or taken
notice of by any of the Councils, that were
afterwards held in <i>Africa</i>; to establish the
Celibacy of the Clergy. Some will have
this Letter to have been written only for
the Bishops of the Vicariate of <i>Rome</i>, of
which <i>Syricius</i> was Primate, and to have
been sent by him to the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>,
and perhaps to those of the other Provinces,
with a Design to try whether they might
not be prompted to receive the Canons it
contained, as general Rules, though made
for the Vicariate only. This had been attempting
to establish at once, and in a
manner by Surprize, an universal Jurisdiction.
But I can hardly believe, that, in
the Days of <i>Syricius</i>, when the Ambition
of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> was yet in its Infancy,
they should have aspired to, or entertained
any Notion of, such a Jurisdiction.
As to the Council, I shall only observe here,
that it is said in all the printed Copies of the
Councils, all the antient Manuscripts, but
one, to have been held at <i>Tela</i>, in the Province
of <i>Byzacene</i>, whereas <i>Tela</i> is allowed,
even by those who defend this Council as
genuine, to have belonged to the <i>Proconsularis</i>.
They have therefore nothing else
to recur to but the Ignorance of the Transcribers,
the usual Refuge in such Cases,
whom they all agree to have been mistaken,
though all equally at a Loss, and at
Variance among themselves, how to correct
the supposed Mistake. For, instead of
<i>Tela</i>, some read <i>Zela</i> or <i>Zella</i>, others <i>Tena</i>,
<i>Teneptis</i>, <i>Teleptus</i>, &amp;c. In short, there
is not a single Town in the whole Province
of <i>Byzacene</i>, bearing the least Resemblance
in Name with <i>Tela</i>, that has not been substituted
in its room; nay, some have bestowed
that Honour on the smallest Villages,
as if it were probable, that, in a
Province, filled, as <i>Byzacene</i> was, with considerable
Cities, and Episcopal Sees, Bishops
should chuse to assemble in a Village. To
read <i>Proconsularis</i> instead of <i>Byzacene</i>, as
some have done, is contradicting, and consequently
giving up, the Acts of that Council;
for the Thirty-three Bishops named
there, as composing it, were all of the latter
Province, and <i>Vincentius</i> and <i>Fortunatianus</i>
are said to have assisted as Deputies
from the former<a id='rN28.2' /><a href='#fN28.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. It would be needless
to dwell any longer on this Subject, and
point out the many Absurdities and Contradictions
that occur in the supposed Acts
of that Council, since the very Title must
convince every impartial Reader, that no
such Council was ever held. I cannot, however,
help taking Notice of a very extraordinary
Canon, quoted by <i>Ferrandus</i>, from
the Letter of <i>Syricius</i>, and approved, as is
said there, by the Council of <i>Tela</i>; <i>viz.</i>
That <i>no Bishop should be ordained by a single
Bishop, the Church of</i> Rome <i>excepted</i>.
This Exception is not to be found in the
Letter ascribed to <i>Syricius</i>, from which they
make <i>Ferrandus</i> quote it; and, besides, the
Bishops of <i>Rome</i> were never ordained by a
single Bishop, nor did they ever take upon
them to ordain Bishops alone.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>I find no farther Mention made of <i>Syricius</i>, in the antient Writers,
till the Year 390. when he condemned the Doctrine of <i>Jovinian</i>;
and cast him and his Followers out of the Church. <i>Jovinian</i> was
by Profession a Monk, by Birth a <i>Latin</i>, as <i>Jerom</i> observes, and the
first who infected that Language with Heresy; all, or rather almost all,
the Heresies that, for the first Four hundred Years, had disturbed the
Peace of the Church, having been broached by <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Chaldæans</i>,
or <i>Syrians</i><a id='r1273' /><a href='#f1273' class='c015'><sup>[1273]</sup></a>. He had formerly practised great Austerities, going bare-footed,
living upon Bread and Water, covered with a tattered black
Garment, and earning his Livelihood with the Sweat of his Brow,
his Hands being callous with long and hard Labour<a id='r1274' /><a href='#f1274' class='c015'><sup>[1274]</sup></a>. The Doctrine
he taught is, by <i>Jerom</i>, reduced to the Four following Heads: 1. That
those, who, with a lively Faith, have been regenerated by Baptism,
cannot afterwards be overcome by the Devil. 2. That for all those,
who shall preserve their Baptism; an equal Reward is reserved in Heaven.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>3. That there is no Difference of Merit between abstaining from
some Meats, and using them with Thanksgiving. 4. and lastly, That
Virgins, Widows, and married Women, are in a State of equal Merit;
and, consequently, that all Difference in Merit can only arise
from their different Actions. That the Two last were then counted
Heresies, shews that the Church began, in this Century, to be tainted
with Doctrines that border on Popery, and no-ways consist with the
Liberty of the Gospel<a id='r1275' /><a href='#f1275' class='c015'><sup>[1275]</sup></a>. Besides these Tenets, <i>Jovinian</i> taught,
as <i>Ambrose</i> and <i>Austin</i> inform us, that the Virgin <i>Mary</i> preserved her
Virginity in conceiving our <i>Saviour</i>, but lost it in bringing him forth,
pretending to prove by Arguments, <i>false, but ingenious enough</i>, say
they, that we should otherwise be obliged to own, with the <i>Manichees</i>,
the Body of <i>Christ</i> not to have been real, but aereal<a id='r1276' /><a href='#f1276' class='c015'><sup>[1276]</sup></a>. He,
besides, charged the Catholics with <i>Manicheism</i>, on account of their
preferring the State of Virginity to that of Matrimony<a id='r1277' /><a href='#f1277' class='c015'><sup>[1277]</sup></a>. Both <i>Jerom</i>
and <i>Ambrose</i> tell us, that, together with his Doctrine, he changed
his Manners, renouncing his former Austerities, and giving himself
up to all manner of Debauchery, to redeem, as it were, the Time he
had lost<a id='r1278' /><a href='#f1278' class='c015'><sup>[1278]</sup></a>. But perhaps this Charge was not well founded, but rather
supposed as a Consequence of his undervaluing Celibacy, and the
Merit ascribed to it, there being too many Instances in Ecclesiastical
History of such Inferences, drawn from Opinions which were not
approved by the Fathers of the Church, as could no-way be justified.
They often painted those, whom they styled Heretics, in the blackest
Colours, to prejudice the People more effectually against their Doctrine.
In this Art <i>Jerom</i> excelled all the rest, and none ever disagreed
with him, who did not at once forfeit those very Virtues, which
he himself had admired and extolled in them before. He abstained,
however, from Matrimony; but merely, say <i>Austin</i> and <i>Jerom</i>, to
avoid the Trouble and Anxiety attending it, and not because he apprehended
there could be in this Life any Merit in Continency, or any
Reward allotted for it in the next<a id='r1279' /><a href='#f1279' class='c015'><sup>[1279]</sup></a>. This Doctrine he broached in
<i>Rome</i>, and soon found there a great Number of Followers, among
the rest several of both Sexes, who had embraced, and professed for
many Years, the State of Virginity, being seduced and misled, says
<i>Austin</i>, by the Cavils of that impious Wretch, asking them, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>they pretended to be more holy than <i>Abraham</i> and <i>Sarah</i>, than
many other Men and Women, who, though married, are commended
in the <i>Old Testament</i>, for their eminent Sanctity<a id='r1280' /><a href='#f1280' class='c015'><sup>[1280]</sup></a>. The first, who
took Offence at this Doctrine, were Two Laymen, <i>viz.</i> <i>Pammachius</i>
and <i>Victorinus</i>. All we know of the latter is, that he was illustrious
for his Birth, and, if we believe <i>Ambrose</i>, venerable for his Piety<a id='r1281' /><a href='#f1281' class='c015'><sup>[1281]</sup></a>.
As for <i>Pammachius</i>, he is well known in the History of the Church,
and often mentioned by <i>Jerom</i> with the greatest Commendations.
He was descended, says that Writer, from the antient Family of the
<i>Camilli</i>, and yet less distinguished by the Nobility of his Descent than
his Piety<a id='r1282' /><a href='#f1282' class='c015'><sup>[1282]</sup></a>. Having heard, by Chance, some of the Propositions advanced
by <i>Jovinian</i>, he made it his Business to inquire more narrowly
into his Doctrine, being assisted therein by <i>Victorinus</i>, who had

<i>Jerom</i><a id='r1283' /><a href='#f1283' class='c015'><sup>[1283]</sup></a>, that <i>a Virgin was no better than a married Woman</i>. These
Two having, by a diligent Inquiry, discovered at length the whole
Doctrine of <i>Jovinian</i>, as well as the Author and Promoters of it,
they presented a Request to <i>Syricius</i>, acquainting him therewith, and
desiring, that the Doctrine of <i>Jovinian</i> might be condemned by the
Episcopal Authority, and the Sentence of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, as contrary
to the Law of God<a id='r1284' /><a href='#f1284' class='c015'><sup>[1284]</sup></a>. These are <i>Ambrose</i>’s Words, as the Text

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Doctrine of</i><br/>Jovinian <i>condemned<br/>by a Council at</i><br/>Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Be that as it will, <i>Syricius</i> did not take upon him to act on
this Occasion by his private Authority; but, assembling the Priests,
Deacons, and other Ecclesiastics of <i>Rome</i>, he read to them the Request
of <i>Pammachius</i> and <i>Victorinus</i>, and, having, together with them,
maturely examined the Doctrine of <i>Jovinian</i>, he declared it, with
the unanimous Consent of the whole Assembly, contrary to Scripture;
and at the same time cut off, for ever, from the Communion of the
Church, not only <i>Jovinian</i>, who had first broached such a Doctrine,
but those among his Followers, who were found to have been the
most sanguine in promoting it; <i>viz.</i> <i>Auxentius</i>, <i>Genialis</i>, <i>Germinator</i>,
<i>Felix</i>, <i>Frontinus</i>, <i>Martianus</i>, <i>Januarius</i>, and <i>Ingenius</i><a id='r1285' /><a href='#f1285' class='c015'><sup>[1285]</sup></a>. <i>Jovinian</i>,
instead of submitting to the Judgment of <i>Syricius</i>, and his
Clergy, immediately left <i>Rome</i>, and repaired with all Speed to <i>Milan</i>,
not despairing of being able to engage <i>Ambrose</i> in his Favour, and
likewise the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, who was then in that City, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span><i>Syricius</i> could prejudice them against him. Of this <i>Syricius</i> was
aware, and therefore, without Loss of Time, dispatched Three of his
Presbyters to <i>Milan</i>, <i>Crescentius</i>, <i>Leopardus</i>, and <i>Alexander</i>, with a Letter
to that Church, which has been transmitted to us among <i>Ambrose</i>’s
Works<a id='r1286' /><a href='#f1286' class='c015'><sup>[1286]</sup></a>, acquainting them with what had passed at <i>Rome</i>. In virtue
of this Letter he was rejected by <i>Ambrose</i>; and, at the Request of the

<p class='c001'>The Letter of <i>Syricius</i> was answered by <i>Ambrose</i>, and signed by
him, and several other Bishops, who were still at <i>Milan</i>, where they
had met to condemn <i>Ithacius</i>, and his Adherents, for having been
accessary to the Death of <i>Priscillian</i>. In their Answer they commend
the Pastoral Vigilance of <i>Syricius</i>, and, having briefly declared
their Opinion against the other Tenets of <i>Jovinian</i>, dwell on what
he had advanced against the Virginity of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>. But they
seem to have mistaken his Meaning, in charging him with <i>Manicheism</i>,
and supposing him to have held, that our Saviour did not
assume a real Body: for he held no such Doctrine, but only charged
the Catholics with it, as <i>Austin</i> tells us in express Terms<a id='r1287' /><a href='#f1287' class='c015'><sup>[1287]</sup></a>. It is
surprising, that such a Question should have thus employed the Thoughts
and Attention of so many venerable Prelates, and created such Feuds
and Animosities in the Church. Both Parties agreed, that the Virgin
<i>Mary</i> had brought forth her Son without the Co-operation or Intercourse
of Man; and in that Sense alone she is styled a Virgin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Law enacted against</i> Jovinian, <i>and his Followers</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>From <i>Milan Jovinian</i> returned to the Neighbourhood of <i>Rome</i>,
where his Followers continued to assemble, under his Direction, till
the Year 398. when the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>, giving Ear to the Complaints
of the neighbouring Bishops, enacted a Law, commanding him
and his Accomplices to be beaten with Whips armed with Lead, and
transported into different Islands<a id='r1288' /><a href='#f1288' class='c015'><sup>[1288]</sup></a>. <i>Jovinian</i> himself was confined
to the Isle of <i>Boas</i>, on the Coast of <i>Dalmatia</i><a id='r1289' /><a href='#f1289' class='c015'><sup>[1289]</sup></a>, where he gave up
the Ghost, about the Year 406. in the Midst of the Mirth and Jollity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of a Banquet, says <i>Jerom</i>, adding that he was revived in <i>Vigilantius</i>,
as <i>Euphorbus</i> was formerly in <i>Pythagoras</i><a id='r1290' /><a href='#f1290' class='c015'><sup>[1290]</sup></a>. Some of <i>Jerom</i>’s Friends
in <i>Rome</i> sent him the Book, which <i>Jovinian</i> had composed to explain
and defend his Doctrine, begging him to confute it. He readily complied
with their Request, and ended his Work in the Year 392. It
consisted of Two Books, but met with a very indifferent Reception at
<i>Rome</i>. For though he declared from the Beginning, that it was not
his Intention to condemn Marriage, and that he had an utter Abhorrence
to the Errors of <i>Marcion</i>, of <i>Tatian</i>, and the <i>Manichees</i>, holding
Marriage to be sinful; yet the disparaging Terms he made use of
in speaking of Marriage, gave great Offence, even to those who professed
Continency<a id='rN30' /><a href='#fN30' class='c015'><sup>[N30]</sup></a>.</p>

took as a Token of the most sincere Friendship;
and therefore, not satisfied with acknowleging
the Obligation he had laid on
him, and commending his Conduct as worthy
of his great Prudence, and answerable
to the Affection which it was owing to, he

<p class='c001'>Notwithstanding the Severity of the Law I have mentioned above,
some still continued to hold, and privately to propagate, the Doctrine
of <i>Jovinian</i>, which induced <i>Austin</i> to compose his Treatise on the
Advantages of Marriage and Virginity; a Performance far more judicious
than that of <i>Jerom</i>, who has taken great Pains to disparage and
cry down Marriage, the better to extol Virginity, as if he could not
commend the one without condemning the other. <i>Austin</i>, on the
contrary, begins his Work with great Encomiums on Matrimony, to
which, however commendable, in the End he prefers Virginity. But
after all, the Reasons alleged by the one as well as the other, are, if
duly weighed, but empty and unconclusive Speculations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>New Disturbances in the Church of</i> Antioch.</div>

<p class='c001'>The following Year, 391. a great Council was convened at <i>Capua</i>,
chiefly with a View to restore Peace to the Church of <i>Antioch</i>, and
put an End to the Schism, which had long prevailed there, and had
occasioned almost an intire Separation between the East and the West,
as I have related elsewhere<a id='r1291' /><a href='#f1291' class='c015'><sup>[1291]</sup></a>. <i>Paulinus</i>, who was acknowleged for
lawful Bishop of that City by Part of the Catholics there, by the
Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Cyprus</i>, by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the Western Bishops, died about the Year 388<a id='r1292' /><a href='#f1292' class='c015'><sup>[1292]</sup></a>. But the unhappy
Division, which had reigned during his Life, continued to reign even
after his Death. For <i>Paulinus</i>, by a most unaccountable Conduct,
and a most notorious and open Violation of the Canons, took upon
him not only to appoint himself a Successor before he died, but to ordain
him alone. The Person whom he thus both named and ordained,
was one <i>Evagrius</i>, a Presbyter, with whom he had always lived
in close Friendship<a id='r1293' /><a href='#f1293' class='c015'><sup>[1293]</sup></a>; and who on that Account was, notwithstanding
his illegal Election and Ordination, acknowleged by <i>Paulinus</i>’s
Party for Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>. <i>Theodoret</i> writes, that the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>, with the other Western Bishops, and those of <i>Egypt</i>, embraced
his Communion<a id='r1294' /><a href='#f1294' class='c015'><sup>[1294]</sup></a>. But <i>Ambrose</i> assures us, that the Bishops of
<i>Egypt</i> stood neuter, suspending all Communication both with <i>Evagrius</i>,
and his Competitor <i>Flavianus</i>; and speaks in such manner of
both, as gives us room to suppose that he himself communicated with
neither. <i>Both rely more on the Invalidity of their Competitor’s Ordination</i>,
says he, <i>than on the Validity of their own. It is therefore
with Reason that</i> Flavianus <i>declines a fair Tryal, and not without
Reason that</i> Evagrius <i>does not demand one</i><a id='r1295' /><a href='#f1295' class='c015'><sup>[1295]</sup></a>. The Example of <i>Ambrose</i>
was, in all Likelihood, followed by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and
the other Western Bishops; or <i>Ambrose</i>, perhaps, conformed to
theirs<a id='rN31' /><a href='#fN31' class='c015'><sup>[N31]</sup></a>.</p>

done. But surely from his espousing the
Cause of <i>Paulinus</i>, who was legally chosen,
against <i>Flavianus</i>, whose Election was contested,
we cannot well conclude, that, in

Part of one whose Election was indisputably

<p class='c001'>All the Bishops of <i>Illyricum</i>, upon the Death of <i>Paulinus</i>, admitted
<i>Flavianus</i>, and not <i>Evagrius</i>, to their Communion, if we may
depend upon <i>Theodoret</i><a id='r1296' /><a href='#f1296' class='c015'><sup>[1296]</sup></a>. As this new Election occasioned unheard-of
Disturbances in the Church of <i>Antioch</i>, as the Division still continued
between the East and the West, the Western Bishops had frequent Recourse
to the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, during the Three Years he passed in
the West, pressing him to oblige, by his Imperial Authority, both
<i>Flavianus</i> and <i>Evagrius</i> to submit their Cause to the Judgment of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Council, that should be held in <i>Italy</i>. <i>Theodosius</i> consented at last to
their Request, named <i>Capua</i> for the Place where the Council should
meet, and took upon him to oblige <i>Flavianus</i> to repair thither at the
Time appointed. Soon after, that is, about the 14th of <i>July</i> 391. he
left <i>Italy</i>, where he had continued ever since the Year 388. settling
young <i>Valentinian</i> on the Throne, and set out for <i>Constantinople</i>,
into which City he made his Entry on the 10th of <i>November</i>. Before
his Departure from <i>Italy</i> he had writ to <i>Flavianus</i>, commanding
him to repair to <i>Constantinople</i>, and wait his Arrival there. <i>Flavianus</i>
readily complied with the Emperor’s Orders, and appeared at
Court the Day after his Arrival. But when the Prince acquainted
him with the Promise he had made to the Western Bishops, and desired
him to prepare for the Journey, which he did in a very obliging
Manner, <i>Flavianus</i> represented to him the Inconveniences, attending
so long a Journey at that Season of the Year, and begged he would
give him Leave to put it off to the Spring, when he would not fail to
obey his Orders. The Emperor, seeing him stricken in Years, thought
the Excuse just and reasonable; and therefore, out of Compassion and
Good nature, allowed him for the present to return to his See<a id='r1297' /><a href='#f1297' class='c015'><sup>[1297]</sup></a>.
Thus did <i>Flavianus</i>, by the Indulgence of the Emperor, avoid the
Judgment of the Western Bishops, who wisely forbore meddling with
so nice a Subject in his Absence, though his Competitor was present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i> Capua.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Council of <i>Capua</i> met in the Latter-end of the Year 391. and
was it seems, a very numerous Assembly, since it is styled, in the
Canons of the Church of <i>Africa</i>, <i>a full Council</i><a id='r1298' /><a href='#f1298' class='c015'><sup>[1298]</sup></a>. But whether it
was composed of all the Western Bishops, or only of the Bishops of
<i>Italy</i>, is uncertain, and cannot be determined from the Words of
<i>Ambrose</i>, <i>We all met</i><a id='r1299' /><a href='#f1299' class='c015'><sup>[1299]</sup></a>, which may be equally understood of both.
As the Acts of this Council have not reached our Times, we do not
even know who presided at it, some conferring that Honour on <i>Ambrose</i><a id='r1300' /><a href='#f1300' class='c015'><sup>[1300]</sup></a>,
some on <i>Syricius</i><a id='r1301' /><a href='#f1301' class='c015'><sup>[1301]</sup></a>, and some on both<a id='r1302' /><a href='#f1302' class='c015'><sup>[1302]</sup></a>. That <i>Syricius</i> presided,
or even assisted, in Person, is not at all probable; for in the
Times I am now writing of, the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> had begun to affect
Grandeur; and, under Pretence that their Presence was necessary in
the great Metropolis of the Empire, to assist or preside in Councils
held elsewhere by their Deputies or Legates, as they are now styled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>That <i>Syricius</i> assisted, by his Deputies, at the Council of <i>Capua</i>, I do
not doubt, since the Council was composed, at least, of all the Bishops
of <i>Italy</i>, and <i>Syricius</i> owned himself bound by their Decrees<a id='r1303' /><a href='#f1303' class='c015'><sup>[1303]</sup></a>.
But that <i>Ambrose</i> presided, seems undeniable, since by him, and him

<p class='c001'>The Council avoided deciding, and even taking into Consideration,
the Affair of <i>Flavianus</i> and <i>Evagrius</i>, in the Absence of the
former, though they had chiefly met for that Purpose. However,
to re-establish the Tranquillity of the Church, they agreed to renew
their Correspondence with, and grant their Communion to, all the
Catholic Bishops of the East. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Difference be-<br/>tween the Two Com-<br/>petitors to the See<br/>of</i> Antioch <i>refered,<br/>by the Council, to<br/>the Bishops of</i> Egypt.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As for the Difference between the Two
Competitors for the See of <i>Antioch</i>, they committed the discussing

Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, as the most proper Judges, since they communicated
with neither, and therefore could not be suspected to favour
the one more than the other<a id='r1304' /><a href='#f1304' class='c015'><sup>[1304]</sup></a>. The Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i> immediately
acquainted <i>Flavianus</i> with the Resolution of the Council,
summoning him, at the same time, to appear, in Compliance therewith,
before the Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, who were soon to assemble, in
order to put the Decree of that venerable Assembly in Execution.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Flavianus <i>refuses to<br/>comply with the De-<br/>cree of the Council.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Flavianus</i>, instead of obeying the Summons, and paying the
Regard that was thought due to the Decree of so numerous a Council,
refused to stir from <i>Antioch</i>, pleading a Rescript, which he had
extorted from <i>Theodosius</i>, commanding the Western Bishops to repair
into the East, and there examine the Affair in a new Council. This
<i>Theophylus</i> did not expect, and therefore being at a Loss how to conduct
himself on such an Emergency, he gave <i>Ambrose</i> immediate
Notice of the Summons he had sent, and the Answer he had received.
<i>Ambrose</i> had nothing so much at Heart as to restore Peace and Tranquillity
to the Church of <i>Antioch</i>; and from the Regard which the
Council had shewn to <i>Flavianus</i>, as well as the Impartiality with
which they had acted with respect to both, he had promised himself
Success in so pious an Undertaking. It was therefore with the utmost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Concern that he saw his Endeavours thus unexpectedly defeated,
and all Hopes of accomplishing what he had undertaken, vanish at
once. He had but too much Reason to resent such an affronting
Conduct, which did not so much affect the Council in general, as
him in particular, since it was at his Motion, that the Council took
the above-mentioned Resolution. That, however, did not tempt him
to depart from the Neutrality he had embraced, and declare for <i>Evagrius</i>:
he still maintained the same Impartiality, and refused to communicate
with either. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Ambrose<i>’s Mod-<br/>eration and Impartiality</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In his Answer to <i>Theophylus</i>, he desires him,

summon <i>Flavianus</i> once more, directing him, at the same time, to
communicate with all the Catholic Bishops of the East, pursuant to
the Decree of the Council, whether he complied with this Second
Summons or no; and to acquaint the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> with what he
had done, that, the Whole being approved by that Church, as he
did not question but it would, the whole Church might be happily
of one Mind, and reap the Fruit of his Labour<a id='r1305' /><a href='#f1305' class='c015'><sup>[1305]</sup></a>.</p>

hold it of them. He therefore answered the Emperor, with great
Calmness and Respect, in the following Terms: <i>Sir, if my Faith is
not thought Orthodox, or my Conduct not worthy of a Catholic Bishop,

as a Saint; and his Festival kept on the 26th of <i>September</i>. And
truly, if we may depend upon the Testimony of the most authentic
and unexceptionable Writers of those Times, we shall hardly find one
in the <i>Roman</i> Calendar more worthy of that Honour. The famous
<i>John Chrysostom</i>, who was one of his Presbyters before his Promotion
to the See of <i>Constantinople</i>, has filled his Homilies with the
Praises of <i>the great Flavianus</i>, as he styles him. His distinguished
Merit, eminent Virtues, and extraordinary Piety, seem to have been
<i>Chrysostom</i>’s favourite Topic; and these Encomiums he bestowed upon
him, while he was still alive. After his Death he was distinguished by
the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i>, with the Title of <i>the blessed Flavianus</i><a id='r1308' /><a href='#f1308' class='c015'><sup>[1308]</sup></a>;
and by that of the East, held under <i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, ranked among
the brightest Luminaries, the most illustrious Prelates, and the greatest
Saints of the Church<a id='r1309' /><a href='#f1309' class='c015'><sup>[1309]</sup></a>. <i>Theodoret</i> never names him without adding
to his Name some Epithet, denoting his extraordinary Merit, such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span><i>the great, the holy, the admirable</i> Flavianus. As therefore no room
is left to doubt of his extraordinary Piety and Merit, we may well
conclude, from his absolutely refusing to submit his Cause to the Judgment
of <i>Syricius</i>, and the other Bishops of the West, that he did not
acknowlege either in him or them a Power to judge him. This Refusal
did not, in the Eyes of <i>Chrysostom</i>, and other great Men, detract
in the least from his Merit, nor lessen the high Opinion they entertained
of his Sanctity. A plain Indication that they did not think his
Conduct reprehensible, and consequently did not acknowlege, more
than he, that Power which is now one main Article of the <i>Roman
Catholic Creed</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Communion<br/>between the East and<br/>the West renewed.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As <i>Flavianus</i> declined the Judgment of the <i>Western</i> as well as the
<i>Egyptian</i> Bishops, and the Emperor gave no farther Ear to their Remonstrances
and Complaints, the Resolution taken by the Council of
<i>Capua</i> was put in Execution; which was, to renew the Communion
and good Understanding between the East and the West, and abandon

<p class='c001'>The Council of <i>Capua</i>, after the above-mentioned Resolution
concerning the Difference between <i>Flavianus</i> and <i>Evagrius</i>,
heard a Charge brought by some Bishops against <i>Bonosus</i>, Bishop
of <i>Naissus</i> in <i>Dacia</i>, according to some, or, as others
will have it, of <i>Sardica</i>, the Metropolis of that Province. He was
accused of a Crime against the Canons of the Church and the Law of
God<a id='r1311' /><a href='#f1311' class='c015'><sup>[1311]</sup></a>, and likewise of Heresy. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Errors.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Crime is not specified; but as
for the Heresy, I gather from <i>Austin</i>, that he held the Son to be inferior
to the Father<a id='r1312' /><a href='#f1312' class='c015'><sup>[1312]</sup></a>; and from <i>Ambrose</i>, that he taught, the Virgin
<i>Mary</i> had had other Children after the Birth of <i>Christ</i><a id='r1313' /><a href='#f1313' class='c015'><sup>[1313]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The judging of his<br/>Cause committed by<br/>the Council to the<br/>neighbouring Bish-<br/>ops, who condemn him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He had, it
seems, been condemned by <i>Damasus</i>, who died in 384<a id='r1314' /><a href='#f1314' class='c015'><sup>[1314]</sup></a>. but still
held his See, and was not driven from it, even by the Council of
<i>Capua</i>. For the Fathers of that Assembly committed the hearing and
judging of his Cause to the Bishops in his Neighbourhood, chiefly to
those of <i>Macedon</i>, under their Metropolitan <i>Anysius</i>, Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i><a id='r1315' /><a href='#f1315' class='c015'><sup>[1315]</sup></a>.
The neighbouring Bishops assembled, pursuant to the Order
of the Council; and <i>Bonosus</i>, as well as his Accusers, appearing
before them, they found the Charge so well supported, that they immediately
forbid him to enter his Church; which was suspending him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>from all Episcopal Functions. <i>Bonosus</i> complained loudly of this
Sentence, and even advised with the Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, whether he
might not, in Defiance of a Judgment so rash and immature, still
exercise the Functions of his Office, and, in case of Opposition, repel
Force with Force. <i>Ambrose</i> exhorted him, in the strongest Terms, to
acquiesce to the Sentence, to conduct himself with the Prudence,
Temper, and Moderation, that became a Bishop; and, above all, not
to undertake any thing that might be interpreted as a Contempt of the
Authority of his Judges, since he could not contemn their Authority,
without contemning at the same time that of the Council, which had
appointed them<a id='r1316' /><a href='#f1316' class='c015'><sup>[1316]</sup></a>. In the mean time the Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>, having
more leisurely examined the Cause of <i>Bonosus</i>, wrote to <i>Syricius</i>, referring
the Decision to him, and declaring their <i>Abhorrence of the
detestable Error, that the Virgin</i> Mary <i>had other Children besides
Christ</i>. If this was an Error, which may well be doubted, it was one
that did no-way affect the Christian Faith, and therefore did not deserve
such a severe Condemnation: but as it thwarted the favourable Opinions
then entertained in the Church concerning Virginity, it is no
Wonder that it should meet with so rough a Treatment<a id='rN35' /><a href='#fN35' class='c015'><sup>[N35]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<div class='footnote' id='fN35'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN35'>N35</a>. That the Virgin <i>Mary</i> had other
Children besides Christ, was not a new Opinion.
It was taught by <i>Helvidius</i> in 383.
and long before him by <i>Tertullian</i>, as <i>Jerom</i>
himself is forced to own in the Treatise
which he wrote against <i>Helvidius</i>: nay, in
the Time of <i>Epiphanius</i>, who flourished
from the Year 366. to 403. that Opinion
universally prevailed in <i>Arabia</i>, as appears
from the Letter which he wrote in Confutation
of it, and addressed to all the Christians
dwelling in <i>Arabia</i>, from the Presbyters
down to the Catechumens. In that
Letter he styles those who denied the perpetual
Virginity of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, <i>Antidicomarianites</i>;
and ranks them, though
their Opinion had not yet been condemned
by the Church, sometimes among the Heretics,
and sometimes among the Schismatics.
But in the same Letter he censures,
with no less Severity, those who adored her,
styling the Worship that was paid her <i>an
idolatrous Heresy</i>; which was taxing those
who paid it both with Heresy and Idolatry;
and from neither will the unmeaning Terms
of <i>Latria</i>, <i>Dulia</i>, <i>Hyperdulia</i>, &amp;c. invented
and used by the Schoolmen to express
different Degrees of Worship, excuse the
present Practice of the Church of <i>Rome</i>.
<i>Epiphanius</i> was unacquainted with such
Terms, as well as with the different Degrees
of Worship answering them; and
therefore called the Meeting of certain
Women, on a stated Day, to offer a Cake
to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, and eat it together in
her Honour (whence they had the Name
of <i>Collyridians</i>), <i>a Folly repugnant to Religion,
an Illusion of the Devil, a robbing
God of the Honour that was due to him, an
idolatrous Heresy</i><a id='rN35.1' /><a href='#fN35.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. These Women came
from the Northern Provinces of <i>Scythia</i>
into <i>Thrace</i>, probably about the Year 372.
when <i>Athanaric</i> King of the <i>Goths</i> drove all
the Christians out of his Dominions. From
<i>Thrace</i> they wandered into <i>Arabia</i>; and
there, in Opposition to the <i>Antidicomarianites</i>,
introduced the above-mentioned idolatrous
Practice. This is the first Instance
of any Worship paid to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>;
and to those Women the extravagant Worship
that is still paid her by the Church of
<i>Rome</i>, owes its Rise. Some of these Women
took upon them to act, at their Meetings,
as Priestesses. This <i>Epiphanius</i> styles
an abominable Abuse, Women being so
utterly incapable, says he, of performing
any Ecclesiastical Functions, that our Saviour
did not grant even to his Mother the
Power of baptizing<a id='rN35.2' /><a href='#fN35.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span><i>Syricius</i>, in his Answer to the Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>, approves their
Sentiments; and employs almost his whole Letter to shew, that the
Virgin <i>Mary</i> was always a Virgin: but as for the Cause of <i>Bonosus</i>,
he tells them, that <i>it was not lawful for him to judge it, since that
Province had been committed to them by the Council of</i> Capua<a id='r1317' /><a href='#f1317' class='c015'><sup>[1317]</sup></a>. And
was not this disclaiming, in the most plain and explicit Terms he

<div class='note-container'>

<div class='footnote' id='fN36'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN36'>N36</a>. Such a Letter, we may be sure, has
not been tamely received by the Partisans
of <i>Rome</i>. Some of them have rejected it
as forged and surreptitious, for no other
Reason, but because <i>Syricius</i> is there made
to disclaim a Power which he undoubtedly
had. But this is evidently begging the
Question<a id='rN36.1' /><a href='#fN36.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Others, finding it conveyed
to us amongst <i>Ambrose</i>’s Letters, have
ascribed it to him, by prefixing his Name
to it. But <i>Ambrose</i> is unluckily named,
and spoken of, in the Body of the Letter:
whence <i>Baronius</i> himself allows it not to
be his<a id='rN36.2' /><a href='#fN36.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The Style afforded great Matter
of Dispute, some thinking it like, and
others unlike, to the Style of <i>Syricius</i>: but
more than the Style, the Title; <i>To</i> Theophilus
<i>and</i> Anysius. The former was Bishop
of <i>Alexandria</i>: And how came he to
be any-ways concerned in the Cause of <i>Bonosus</i>?
If that Name was common to
him with some Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>, how
came that Bishop to be named before <i>Anysius</i>
his Metropolitan<a id='rN36.3' /><a href='#fN36.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>? In the Height
of these Disputes, <i>Holstenius</i> published the
above-mentioned Letter at <i>Rome</i>, under
the Name of <i>Syricius</i>, from a very antient
and authentic Manuscript, with the following
Title, <i>To</i> Anysius <i>and the other Bishops
of</i> Illyricum<a id='rN36.4' /><a href='#fN36.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>. This turned the Controversy
into another Chanel; for the
Dispute was no more concerning the Authenticit,
but the Sense, of the Letter,
which the Sticklers for the See of <i>Rome</i> began
to think very different from the Sense
that the Words of <i>Syricius</i> had conveyed
to them before; nay, those who had rejected
the Letter as spurious, for no other
Reason but because <i>Syricius</i> was there
made to disown a Power which he undoubtedly
had, were not ashamed now to
maintain, that he disowned no such Power.
Some of them have a particular Faculty
or Talent at making Authors say what
they never thought or dreamt of; nay, at
making them affirm what they flatly deny,
and deny what they positively affirm. But
they have not been so successful on this as
on several other Occasions. The Words of
<i>Syricius</i> are too plain and precise to admit
of any plausible, or even probable,
Misinterpretation. To avoid therefore the
tiresome and unnecessary Task of confuting
the forced Interpretations they have put on
the Words of <i>Syricius</i>, I refer the Reader
to his Letter, which is the Fifth amongst
<i>Ambrose</i>’s Letters; and leave him to judge,
whether it was possible for him to disclaim,
in Terms less liable to Misinterpretations,
the Power of judging a Cause committed
by a Council to the Judgment of others,
which was disclaiming, in other Words,
that universal Jurisdiction, which his Successors
have usurped, and pretend to exercise
by Divine Right.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>As <i>Syricius</i> declined the judging of <i>Bonosus</i>, his Cause was in the

It was at the same time decreed, that those who had been ordained
 by him after the first Sentence, that is, after his Suspension,
should retain the Degrees to which he had raised them. This Indulgence
was shewn, as is declared in the Decree, contrary to the common
Rule, <i>on account of the present Necessity</i>; that is, lest they
should adhere to <i>Bonosus</i>, and form a Schism<a id='r1318' /><a href='#f1318' class='c015'><sup>[1318]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He ordains some by<br/>force.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Bonosus</i>, though

them there against their Will<a id='r1319' /><a href='#f1319' class='c015'><sup>[1319]</sup></a>: a kind of Rape never heard of before.
What Advantage he could propose to himself or others in so doing,
we are not told, and it is not easy to guess. The Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>
allowed even those, who were thus ordained, to keep their respective
Degrees in the Catholic Church, upon their only receiving the Benediction
of a lawful Bishop. Hence those, who found themselves excluded
by the Church from holy Orders, on account of their scandalous
Lives, applied to <i>Bonosus</i>, pretending to espouse his Party, but
left him as soon as they had obtained the Degree they wanted<a id='r1320' /><a href='#f1320' class='c015'><sup>[1320]</sup></a>. <i>Bonosus</i>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An End put to the Schism of</i> Antioch.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Syricius</i> had, in the last Year of his Life, the Satisfaction of seeing
an End put at length to the Schism of <i>Antioch</i>, which I have had so
frequent Occasion to speak of; and the East and West, after so long a
Misunderstanding, or rather Separation, happily reunited. This great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Work was accomplished in the following Manner: <i>Evagrius</i>, the
Successor of <i>Paulinus</i>, dying not long after his Promotion, <i>Flavianus</i>
employed all the Credit and Interest he had at Court, and with
the Clergy of <i>Antioch</i>, to prevent the Election of a new Bishop in
the room of the deceased: and so far his Endeavours proved successful.
But he could by no means gain the <i>Eustathians</i>, who continued to
assemble apart, or prevail either upon the Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, or <i>Syricius</i>,
and the other Western Bishops, to admit him to their Communion,
though he had no Competitor, whose Cause they could
espouse against him. Thus, through the inflexible Obstinacy of the
<i>Egyptian</i> and Western Bishops, was Discord kept alive, and a kind
of Schism fomented among the Prelates and Members of the Catholic
Church, says <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r1321' /><a href='#f1321' class='c015'><sup>[1321]</sup></a>. In this Situation Affairs continued from the
Year 392. in which <i>Evagrius</i> died, to the Year 398. when the
famous <i>John Chrysostom</i>, Presbyter of the Church of <i>Antioch</i>, was,
in regard of his extraordinary Merit, preferred to the See of <i>Constantinople</i>.
No sooner was he placed in that high Station, than his
generous Disposition, above all little Piques and Jealousies, his Zeal
for the Welfare of the Church in general, and the tender Regard he
had for that of <i>Antioch</i> in particular, prompted him to employ all the
Credit and Authority, which his new Dignity gave him, in bringing
about an intire Reconciliation between the East and the West, and restoring
the Church of <i>Antioch</i> to the Communion of those Churches,
from which it had been so long separated<a id='r1322' /><a href='#f1322' class='c015'><sup>[1322]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> Chrysostom <i>studies to reconcile the Eastern and Western Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Chrysostom</i> had been consecrated
by <i>Theophilus</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, whom the Council of
<i>Capua</i> had appointed to decide, with the other Bishops of <i>Egypt</i>, the
Difference between <i>Flavianus</i> and <i>Evagrius</i>, as I have related above.
To him therefore, before he left <i>Constantinople</i> to return to <i>Egypt</i>,
the new Bishop of that City, impatient to see so great a Work brought
to a happy Issue, imparted his Intention of attempting a Reconciliation
between <i>Flavianus</i> and <i>Syricius</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, earnestly intreating
him to second and promote with his Endeavours an Undertaking
truly worthy of the Two first Bishops of the East.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Flavianus <i>and</i> Theo-<br/>philus <i>reconciled</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>There had subsisted a Misunderstanding between <i>Theophilus</i> and
<i>Flavianus</i> ever since the Year 391. when the Council of <i>Capua</i> was
held. <i>Flavianus</i> had refused to submit  his Cause to the Judgment
of <i>Theophilus</i>, pursuant to the Resolution of that Council; which he
had highly resented; and, in the Height of his Resentment, as he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>a Man of a fiery and choleric Temper, he had written to <i>Flavianus</i> in
a very haughty and imperious Style. To these Letters <i>Nestorius</i>, no
doubt, alludes, where he tells us, that <i>Egypt</i> could not, by her menacing
Letters, though written in the Style, and with all the Haughtiness,
of an imperious Tyrant, move or terrify the blessed <i>Flavianus</i><a id='r1323' /><a href='#f1323' class='c015'><sup>[1323]</sup></a>.
It was necessary, in the first place, to remove the Misunderstanding which
had so long subsisted between these Two Prelates; and in this <i>Chrysostom</i>
met with no Difficulty or Obstruction, <i>Theophilus</i> readily agreeing
to the Terms he proposed in the Name of <i>Flavianus</i>, and <i>Flavianus</i> ratifying
them, upon the first Notice, without the least Exception or Limitation.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Chrysostom <i>attempts<br/>a Reconciliation<br/>between</i> Flavianus<br/><i>and</i> Syricius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  What these Terms were, we are no-where told; but it is
certain, that, all Disputes being thereby composed, the Bishops of <i>Alexandria</i>
and <i>Antioch</i> were intirely reconciled, and the Communion
between them renewed, to the great Satisfaction of both<a id='r1324' /><a href='#f1324' class='c015'><sup>[1324]</sup></a>. The
next Thing to be attempted, and, as was apprehended, the most difficult
to be accomplished, was the reconciling of <i>Syricius</i> with the
Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, who had now held that See Seventeen Years, but
had not been able, notwithstanding the great Character he bore, to
obtain the Communion of <i>Syricius</i>, or any of his Predecessors, on
account of their strong Prejudice against him, as well as his Predecessor
<i>Meletius</i>, and their obstinate Attachment to the contrary Party,
in Opposition to the far greater Part of the Eastern Bishops. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His prudent Conduct.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But the
Zeal of <i>Chrysostom</i> was Proof against all Difficulties. Not despairing
therefore of Success, he took the most effectual Means a consummate
Prudence could dictate, to obtain it, advising the Bishops of <i>Antioch</i>
and <i>Alexandria</i> to acquaint the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, by a solemn Embassy,
with their Reconciliation, and at the same time to beg, in the Name
of <i>Flavianus</i>, the Communion of that See. This he knew would
flatter the Vanity of <i>Syricius</i>, and be of more Weight than any Remonstrances
they could make. They readily fell in with the Proposal,
and Deputies were immediately chosen to put it in Execution.
These were <i>Acacius</i> Bishop of <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, <i>Demetrius</i> of <i>Pessinus</i>, and
several other Bishops, with <i>Isidorus</i> Presbyter and Hospitaler of the
Church of <i>Alexandria</i>, and a great Number of Presbyters and Deacons
of the Church of <i>Antioch</i>. <i>Acacius</i>, who was at the Head of this
Deputation, was charged by <i>Chrysostom</i> to present to <i>Syricius</i> the
Decree of his Election to the See of <i>Constantinople</i><a id='r1325' /><a href='#f1325' class='c015'><sup>[1325]</sup></a>. That so great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>an Honour might not be conferred in vain on the See of <i>Rome</i>, it was
thought adviseable to acquaint <i>Syricius</i> with their Design, before they
set out, and to be well assured of a kind Reception on their Arrival
in the West. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Syricius <i>and</i> Flav-<br/>ianus <i>reconciled</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They gave him accordingly early Notice of their Intention,
and he, taken with the Bait, readily promised to settle
every thing to their Satisfaction<a id='r1326' /><a href='#f1326' class='c015'><sup>[1326]</sup></a>; which he did accordingly, receiving
them, on their Arrival at <i>Rome</i>, with the greatest Marks of Respect
and Esteem, and admitting <i>Flavianus</i> to his Communion. From
<i>Rome</i> the Deputies repaired into <i>Egypt</i>, where all the Bishops, following
the Example of <i>Theophilus</i> and <i>Syricius</i>, acknowleged <i>Flavianus</i>
for lawful Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, and, assembling in Council,
with great Solemnity, embraced his Communion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Misunderstand-<br/>ing between the East<br/>and the West intirely<br/>removed.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From <i>Egypt</i> the

Letters of Communion from the Western and <i>Egyptian</i> Bishops,
completed the great Work, and with it their Deputation<a id='r1327' /><a href='#f1327' class='c015'><sup>[1327]</sup></a>. Thus
was an End put, at last, to the Schism of <i>Antioch</i>; and, after
so many Years of Strife and Contention, a perfect Harmony and good
Understanding were settled anew between the East and the West<a id='rN38' /><a href='#fN38' class='c015'><sup>[N38]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN38'>N38</a>. If <i>Syricius</i> is to blame (and who,
but <i>Baronius</i>, can excuse him?) for not
acknowleging <i>Flavianus</i>, at least after the
Death of <i>Paulinus</i>, the Election of his Successor
<i>Evagrius</i> being unquestionably uncanonical
and illegal; how much more is
he to blame for not acknowleging him even
after the Death of <i>Evagrius</i>, when he had
no Pretence whatsoever for denying him
his Communion, and by granting it he
might have put an End to the Schism? <i>Baronius</i>,
to conceal the Truth, and mislead
his Readers, takes a great deal of Pains, in
his Account of this Schism, to place in a
false Light all the Transactions relating to
it. But, in spite of all the Art he has
been able to use, to varnish over the Conduct
of <i>Syricius</i>, and impose on the Public,
it must appear undeniable to every impartial,
I may say, to every rational, Man,
that the Schism, and the many Evils attending
it, which are pathetically described
by <i>Chrysostom</i>, who was then at <i>Antioch</i><a id='rN38.1' /><a href='#fN38.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
were intirely owing to the Pride and Obstinacy
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, at least during
the last Six Years, that is, from the Year
382. when <i>Evagrius</i> died, to 388. when
he yielded, at last, upon his being courted
to it by a solemn Embassy. He had nothing
then to object against the Election,
and much less against the Conduct of <i>Flavianus</i>;
and, if he had nothing then, he
could have nothing before; so that it was
merely from a haughty and obstinate Spirit
that he refused to communicate with him,
and, by such a Refusal, kept up and fomented
a Division so pernicious to the
Church. <i>Baronius</i> represents him as labouring
with indefatigable Pains to restore the
Tranquillity of the Church, and leaving
nothing unattempted that could any-ways
contribute to the promoting of so pious an
Undertaking, an Undertaking which he
had so much at Heart. But that he had nothing
at Heart besides the Glory of his See,
is but too manifest from his Conduct; for
the Minute that was saved, as it was by the
above-mentioned Deputation, all the Difficulties
vanished at once, which till then had
obstructed the Work. As for the Conduct
of <i>Flavianus</i>, in refusing to submit his
Cause to the Judgment of the Council of
<i>Capua</i>, or of the <i>Egyptian</i> Bishops, appointed
to judge it by that Council, it must appear,
if impartially considered, more worthy
of Commendation than Blame, tho’
condemned, in very unbecoming Terms, by
the Sticklers for the See of <i>Rome</i>. He had
been chosen in the Oecumenical Council
of <i>Constantinople</i>, in the Year 381. by the
unanimous Voice of all the Bishops of the
Diocese of the East, or the Patriarchate of
<i>Antioch</i>, and soon after ordained in their
Presence, at <i>Antioch</i>, with the Approbation
of <i>Nestorius</i>, then Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>,
and the loud Acclamations of the far greater
Part of the People of <i>Antioch</i>, promising
themselves, in him, a second <i>Meletius</i>, in
whose room he was chosen<a id='rN38.2' /><a href='#fN38.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Being thus
chosen and ordained, he was acknowleged
by all the Bishops of the East, except those
of <i>Egypt</i>, of the Island of <i>Cyprus</i>, and <i>Arabia</i>.
Could he therefore, without shamefully
betraying <i>the undoubted Right, which
the Bishops of each Diocese had of chusing
their Metropolitan</i>, suffer his Election to be
questioned and canvassed by the Western
Bishops, who had no Concern in it; and,
besides, had openly espoused the Cause of
his Competitor <i>Paulinus</i>, and supported
him, so long as he lived, with the most
open and avowed Partiality? Could he,
without foregoing, in a manner still more
shameful, both his own Right, and that of
his Electors, out of Compliance to the Bishops
assembled at <i>Capua</i>, put himself upon
the Level with <i>Evagrius</i>, whose Election
and Ordination were undoubtedly illegal?
Besides, <i>Flavianus</i> was sensible, that the
Eastern Bishops would have paid no manner
of Regard to the Sentence of the Council;
that, had the Council adjudged the See
of <i>Antioch</i> to <i>Evagrius</i>, such a Judgment,
instead of closing, would have widened the
Breach between the East and the West; and
consequently, that his complying with their
Summons, far from answering the End they
proposed to themselves, would more probably
have had a quite contrary Effect, since
he had but too much room to suppose,
that the strong Prejudice, which they had
on all Occasions betrayed against him,
would incline them to favour his Competitor,
notwithstanding the known Illegality
both of his Election and Ordination. It
was therefore, upon the Whole, very prudent
in him to decline putting the Affair
upon that Issue.</p>

was not therein attended with the wished for Success. The Glory
of completing so great and desirable a Work was, by Providence,
reserved for <i>Alexander</i>, one of his Successors, who had the Satisfaction
of seeing all Party-Names laid aside, and the whole People of <i>Antioch</i>
united in one Flock, under one and the same Shepherd. This
Union was made with great Solemnity, in the Year 415. Eleven
Years after the Death of <i>Flavianus</i>, and Eighty-five after the Beginning
of the Schism. Thus <i>Theodoret</i>, in his Ecclesiastical History<a id='r1328' /><a href='#f1328' class='c015'><sup>[1328]</sup></a>.

which none of his Competitors have deserved, though as much
caressed and favoured by the Two Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Damasus</i> and
<i>Syricius</i>, as he was opposed and ill used. How fallible have the Bishops
of that See shewed themselves, from the earliest Times, in their
Judgment of things! How rash in taking Parties, and fomenting
Discords! How obstinate and inflexible in maintaining the Cause,
which they had once undertaken, let it be ever so bad! The only
thing that can be alleged against the Character of <i>Flavianus</i>, is his
having accepted the Bishoprick of <i>Antioch</i>, contrary to the Oath he
had taken, on Occasion of the Agreement between <i>Meletius</i> and
<i>Paulinus</i>, as I have related above<a id='r1330' /><a href='#f1330' class='c015'><sup>[1330]</sup></a>. That he took such an Oath, is
vouched both by <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Sozomen</i><a id='r1331' /><a href='#f1331' class='c015'><sup>[1331]</sup></a>. But as he was looked
upon by all the East, and extolled by <i>Chrysostom</i>, even in his Life-time,
as a Prelate of an unblemished Character, and never reproached,
even by his greater Enemies, with such an Oath, in the many
Disputes that arose about his Election, I had rather charge those Two
Writers with one Mistake more (for they are guilty of many others),
than a Man of <i>Flavianus</i>’s Probity with such a scandalous Prevarication.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Syricius</i> did not long enjoy the Satisfaction he had, to see the

have been a Man of a tender, compassionate, and generous Temper;

from the Wrath of the Emperor, to maintain the Rights of the

him worthy of a Place in the <i>Roman</i> Martyrology. It is well known,
that the Charge of revising and correcting the <i>Roman</i> Martyrology
was committed, by Pope <i>Gregory</i> XIII. to <i>Baronius</i>, with full Power
to reject such as he should judge unworthy, and admit others in their
room, whom he should declare worthy of the public Worship, and
a Place there<a id='rN39' /><a href='#fN39' class='c015'><sup>[N39]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Why expunged by</i><br/>Baronius <i>out of the<br/>Calendar of Saints</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>The Keys of Heaven</i>, says a modern Writer, speaking
of that Charge, <i>were taken from</i> Peter, <i>and given to</i> Baronius;
<i>for it was not by</i> Peter, <i>but by</i> Baronius, <i>that some were excluded
from, and others admitted into, Heaven</i><a id='r1338' /><a href='#f1338' class='c015'><sup>[1338]</sup></a>. He then shews, that by
this <i>Second Minos</i>, as he styles him, several were driven from the
Seats they had long held in Heaven, and to which they had a just
Claim, to make room for others, who had no Claim. Among the
former he names <i>Syricius</i>, whom he thinks <i>Baronius</i> ought to have
treated in a more friendly manner, upon the Recommendation of
<i>Ambrose</i>, of the Council of <i>Milan</i>, and of <i>Isidore</i>. What thus prejudiced
<i>Baronius</i> against him, and outweighed, in his Scales, all the
Recommendations that could be produced in his Favour, was his Indifference
for <i>Jerom</i> and <i>Paulinus</i>, and the Kindness he shewed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span><i>Ruffinus</i>, <i>Jerom</i>’s Antagonist. <i>Syricius</i>, instead of protecting <i>Jerom</i>,
as his Predecessor <i>Damasus</i> had done, against the <i>Roman</i> Clergy,
whom he had provoked with his Writings, gave him, in a manner,
up to their Resentment; which obliged him to abandon <i>Rome</i>, and
return into the East, as I have related above. The Name of <i>Paulinus</i>,
afterwards Bishop of <i>Nola</i>, is famous in the History of the Church,
and celebrated by <i>Jerom</i>, <i>Ambrose</i>, <i>Austin</i>, and all the Writers of
those Times. He had abandoned the World, and the immense
Wealth he possessed, to lead a retired Life; and, in the Year 395.
he passed through <i>Rome</i>, in his Way to <i>Nola</i>, which he had chosen
for the Place of his Retirement. The Treatment he met with at
<i>Rome</i>, from that Clergy, and <i>Syricius</i> himself, must have been very
unworthy of a Man of his Character, since it obliged him, as he
himself writes<a id='r1339' /><a href='#f1339' class='c015'><sup>[1339]</sup></a>, to quit the City in great Haste, and pursue his Journey
to <i>Nola</i>. Two Years afterwards <i>Ruffinus</i> came to <i>Rome</i>, and there
met with a very different Reception. For <i>Syricius</i> received him, tho’
violently suspected of <i>Origenism</i>, with the greatest Marks of Esteem
and Affection; and, after having entertained him a whole Year, gave
him Letters of Communion at his Departure. Of this <i>Jerom</i> complains,
as if Advantage had been taken of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>’s Simplicity,
to impose upon him<a id='r1340' /><a href='#f1340' class='c015'><sup>[1340]</sup></a>. I will not pretend, as some have
done, to justify <i>Ruffinus</i>; but cannot help observing, that such a
Charge ought not to be admitted against him, upon the bare Authority
of <i>Jerom</i>, or of those, who have only copied what he writ.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN39'>N39</a>. The <i>Roman</i> Martyrology contains
the Names of such Saints as may be publicly
worshiped, and of the Places where
they died, with a succinct Account of the
most remarkable Feats which they are supposed
to have performed. I said, <i>who are
publicly worshiped</i>; for in private every one
is allowed to honour, worship, and invoke
whom they please, provided they have sufficient
Grounds to believe them in <i>a State
of Happiness</i>, or <i>in the Way to it</i>, that is,
in Heaven, or in Purgatory; for the Souls
in Purgatory may be privately worshiped
and invoked; nay, most of the Popish Divines
are now of Opinion, that even a
canonized Saint may be still in Purgatory.
When Learning began to revive, many
gross Mistakes were discovered in the <i>Roman</i>,
as well as in the other Martyrologies,
some being placed among the Saints, and
consequently worshiped as Saints, who had
been notorious Sinners; and others daily
invoked, who had never existed. That the
Church therefore might be no longer misled
in her Worship, <i>Gregory</i> XIII. thought
it necessary to interpose his <i>infallible Authority</i>;
and, having accordingly, ordered
<i>Baronius</i> to revise and correct the <i>Roman</i>
Martyrology, he confirmed, by a special
Bull, dated the 14th of <i>January</i> 1584. all
the Emendations, Additions, Corrections,
<i>&amp;c.</i> which <i>Baronius</i> had been pleased to
make, threatening with <i>the Indignation of
the Almighty God, and of his Apostles St.</i>
Peter <i>and St.</i> Paul, all who should presume
to make any further Alterations. And yet
many Alterations have been made since
<i>Gregory</i>’s Time; and that many more
might and ought to be made, has been sufficiently
shewn by many Protestant, and
some Roman Catholic, Divines.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerom <i>and</i> Ruffinus <i>quarrel</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Jerom</i> and <i>Ruffinus</i> had lived several Years in close Friendship, and
great Intimacy; but, falling out in the Year 393. their former Friendship
was turned at once into an open and avowed Enmity. What
gave Occasion to this Breach I shall relate hereafter, and only observe
here, that <i>Jerom</i> not only quarreled with <i>Ruffinus</i>, but with all the
Friends of <i>Ruffinus</i>; nay, and with those too, who, professing an equal
Friendship for both, would not break with either, or any-ways interfere
in the Quarrel. Among these was the celebrated <i>Roman</i> Matron
<i>Melania</i>, so frequently spoken of, and so highly commended,
by <i>Austin</i>, by <i>Paulinus</i>, and, above all, by <i>Jerom</i> himself, who has
filled his Letters with her Praises, proposing her as a true Pattern of
every Virtue becoming her Sex.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerom <i>quarrels with all the Friends of</i> Ruffinus, <i>especially with</i> Melania.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Melania</i> had retired with <i>Ruffinus</i> to <i>Jerusalem</i>, Twenty-seven
Years before, and continued there practising, under his Direction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>those Works of Charity, which <i>Jerom</i> so often admires and extols.
It could not therefore be expected that she should discard the <i>Partner
of her holy Life, and all her good Works</i>, as <i>Paulinus</i> styles him<a id='r1341' /><a href='#f1341' class='c015'><sup>[1341]</sup></a>,
the Minute the other was pleased to dislike him, or, indeed, that she
should take any Part at all in the Quarrel. And yet, because she
prudently declined taking Part, but continued to shew the same
Affection and Esteem for <i>Ruffinus</i>, which she had done before; <i>Jerom</i>,
forgetful of the Regard that was due to a Matron of her Birth
and Piety, and of the high Encomiums which he had himself bestowed
on her, began to inveigh with no less Bitterness against her,
than against <i>Ruffinus</i> himself. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Conduct towards<br/>her.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In one of his Letters, still extant<a id='r1342' /><a href='#f1342' class='c015'><sup>[1342]</sup></a>,
after finding Fault with one of <i>Ruffinus</i>’s Friends, thought to be
<i>John</i> Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, he adds; “But, after all, he is not so much
to blame as his Instructors <i>Ruffinus</i> and <i>Melania</i>, who, with a great
deal of Trouble and Pains, have taught him to know nothing.” <i>Ruffinus</i>
tells us, that <i>Jerom</i>, finding that <i>Melania</i>, who was a Matron
of great Judgment and Penetration, did not approve of his Actions
and Conduct, thereupon spitefully erased out of his Chronicle,
what he had there written in her Praise<a id='r1343' /><a href='#f1343' class='c015'><sup>[1343]</sup></a>. But he did not, nor was
it, perhaps, in his Power to make such an Alteration in all the Copies;
for what he is said to have cancelled, is still remaining in all the
printed, as well as manuscript Copies of that Work, which have
reached our Times. <i>Melania</i> lived Eighteen Years after, steadily pursuing
the same Course of Life, for which <i>Jerom</i> had once proposed
her as a Pattern to her whole Sex<a id='r1344' /><a href='#f1344' class='c015'><sup>[1344]</sup></a>. She died at <i>Jerusalem</i> in the
Year 411. and died poor, having spent an immense Estate in relieving
the Needy and Indigent, not only of the Countries where she
lived, and through which she passed, but those too of the most distant
Provinces of the Empire. For Persons in Poverty and Distress,
whether in <i>Persia</i> or <i>Britain</i>, says the Author of her Life<a id='r1345' /><a href='#f1345' class='c015'><sup>[1345]</sup></a>, were
alike the Objects of her Charity, and felt alike the Effects of her
Generosity and Good-nature. She died, but with her did not die
the Rancour and Spleen which <i>Jerom</i> had for so many Years harboured
in his Breast against her. For, carrying his Resentment even
beyond the Grave, while the Poor were every-where bemoaning, with
Tears, the Loss of so generous a Benefactress, while the Writers
were paying the deserved Tribute of Praise to the Virtues of so pious a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Matron, <i>Jerom</i>, instead of joining the rest in the common Grief,
strove to dry up their Tears, to drown their Praises, by throwing out
several peevish and ill-natured Reflections on the Memory of the Deceased.
As the famous <i>Pelagius</i> had inscribed a Book to her before
he broached his Opinions, <i>Jerom</i>, in the Letter which he writ to
<i>Ctesiphon</i> against the <i>Pelagians</i>, could not forbear bringing her in,
and observing on that Occasion, with a malignant Quibble, that the
very Name of <i>Melania</i> bespoke (in the <i>Greek</i> Tongue), and sufficiently
declared, the <i>Blackness</i> of her Treachery and Perfidiousness<a id='r1346' /><a href='#f1346' class='c015'><sup>[1346]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Syricius <i>not to be condemned on the bare Authority of</i> Jerom.</div>

<p class='c001'>Such was the Conduct of <i>Jerom</i> towards that illustrious Matron, in
her Life-time, and after her Death. From this Conduct I leave the
Reader to judge, whether the Authority of so prejudiced a Writer
ought to have been of such Weight with <i>Baronius</i> as to make him
exclude her, as well as <i>Syricius</i>, from the <i>Roman</i> Martyrology, or
the Calendar of Saints. Should we grant <i>Ruffinus</i> to have really
held the Errors which <i>Jerom</i> charged him with, it must still be
owned, that <i>Melania</i> acted, as became a Person of her Wisdom,
Piety, and Experience, in suspending her Judgment, and not breaking
with <i>Ruffinus</i>, till she was otherwise convinced, than by the Invectives
of his Antagonist, equally levelled against herself, that he
was no longer worthy of her Friendship and Regard. As for <i>Syricius</i>,
<i>Jerom</i> rather commends than blames him, even where he complains
of his Kindness to <i>Ruffinus</i>. For he only says, that <i>Ruffinus</i>
abused the Simplicity of <i>Syricius</i>, who judged of the Spirit of others
from his own<a id='r1347' /><a href='#f1347' class='c015'><sup>[1347]</sup></a>; which was saying, in other Words, that he was a
good Man, but mistaken in his Judgment, or not infallible: so that
his only Crime, according to <i>Jerom</i>, was want of Infallibility. However,
upon the Authority of that Father, <i>Baronius</i> not only condemns
the Conduct of <i>Syricius</i>, but, rashly prying into the inscrutable Secrets
of Providence, pretends his Days to have been shortened for
the Countenance he gave to <i>Ruffinus</i>, and the Remissness he shewed
in suppressing the Errors, with which he was charged. It is certain,
that <i>Ruffinus</i> was well received, and entertained, in a very hospitable
manner, by <i>Syricius</i>, during his Stay at <i>Rome</i>; and that, upon
his leaving that City, he received from him Letters of Communion.
Now, if <i>Syricius</i> did not know, or did not believe, that <i>Ruffinus</i> held
those Errors, how unjust is it to blame him for the Kindness he

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Misunderstand-<br/>ing between</i> Syricius<br/><i>and</i> Paulinus <i>no<br/>Charge against</i> Syr-<br/>icius.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Treatment <i>Paulinus</i> of <i>Nola</i> met with from <i>Syricius</i>,
there was, no doubt, a Misunderstanding between them; but, as I am
quite in the Dark as to the Cause of it, I will not take upon me to
condemn the one rather than the other. Perhaps they were both to
blame; perhaps they both meant well, and neither was to blame.
However that be, the Misunderstanding between them was soon removed;
for, during the remaining Part of <i>Syricius</i>’s Life, <i>Paulinus</i>
went constantly to <i>Rome</i> once a Year, as he himself declares, in one
of his Letters<a id='r1348' /><a href='#f1348' class='c015'><sup>[1348]</sup></a>. <i>Syricius</i>, it is true, did not take <i>Jerom</i> into his
Protection, as his Predecessor had done, nor shew him the same Kindness;
which is the Third Charge brought by <i>Baronius</i> against him,
but of no more Weight than the other Two, that is, of none at all.
<i>Jerom</i>, prompted by his Zeal, and censorious Temper, could not
help inveighing, with great Bitterness, in all his Writings, against the
Looseness and Debauchery, which universally prevailed, in his Time,
among the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, and the pious Frauds they made use of to
extort Legacies and Presents from old Men, from Widows, and from
Orphans. <i>Syricius</i> might have been as much offended at the Vices
of his Libertine Clergy, as <i>Jerom</i> was, and even studied to reform
them; but, at the same time, be glad, without deserving the least
Reproach on that score, to get rid of so troublesome a Censor, who
thus exposed their Irregularities to the Eyes, and them to the Contempt,
of the World<a id='rN41' /><a href='#fN41' class='c015'><sup>[N41]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN41'>N41</a>. The Festival of <i>Syricius</i> was never
kept, it seems, by public Authority; but
is marked in some antient Martyrologies,
on the 22d of <i>February</i>, and in others on
the 26th of <i>November</i>. The last was more
probably the Day of his Death, since he is
said, both by <i>Prosper</i> and <i>Isidore</i>, to have
governed 14 Years, to complete which one
Month only will be wanting, if we place
his Death on that Day; and several, if with

Twenty Days, according to some; and, according to others, of
near Two Months. He was no sooner chosen, than he writ a kind
and obliging Letter to <i>Paulinus</i>, then at <i>Nola</i> in <i>Campania</i>, and an
other in his Commendation to the Bishops of that Province<a id='r1351' /><a href='#f1351' class='c015'><sup>[1351]</sup></a>. This
he is supposed to have done, in order to efface the bad Impression,
which the Treatment <i>Paulinus</i> had met with in the Time of <i>Syricius</i>,
might have given him against that See, and the <i>Roman</i> Clergy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>What occasioned the<br/>Quarrel between</i><br/>Jerom <i>and</i> Ruffinus.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in the Time of <i>Anastasius</i>, and soon after his Election, that
the famous Dispute arose between <i>Jerom</i> and <i>Ruffinus</i>, which was
afterwards carried on with a Warmth on both Sides quite unbecoming
Men of their Profession. Of this Quarrel, and the Part <i>Anastasius</i>
acted on that Occasion, the Writers of those Times give us the following
Account. <i>Ruffinus</i>, a Presbyter of <i>Aquileia</i>, and a great
Admirer of <i>Origen</i>, having accompanied <i>Melania</i>, whom he had attended
Twenty-five Years at <i>Jerusalem</i>, on her Return to <i>Rome</i> in the
Time of <i>Syricius</i>, was received there with extraordinary Marks of
Esteem by the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, and <i>Syricius</i> himself, as I have observed
elsewhere<a id='r1352' /><a href='#f1352' class='c015'><sup>[1352]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Ruffinus <i>translates</i><br/>Origen<i>’s</i>Peri-<br/>archon.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Encouraged by the Reception he met with, he continued
a whole Year at <i>Rome</i>; and during that Time published, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>without putting his Name to it, a <i>Latin</i> Translation of <i>Origen</i>’s <i>Periarchon</i>,
or <i>Treatise of Principles</i>, having first removed the Prejudice
which some might entertain against that Writer, by the Translation
of an Apology, which the Martyr <i>Pamphylus</i> had composed in
his Vindication, while he was in Prison. To this Apology he added
a Piece of his own, shewing that most of the Errors ascribed to <i>Origen</i>
had been maliciously inserted into his Works by his Enemies after his
Death<a id='r1353' /><a href='#f1353' class='c015'><sup>[1353]</sup></a>. In the Preface to the <i>Periarchon</i> itself he also declared,
that, in Imitation of a learned Brother, meaning <i>Jerom</i>, who had
translated above Seventy of <i>Origen</i>’s Books, he had either corrected
or suppressed such Errors as had appeared to him repugnant to the
Articles of the Catholic Faith<a id='r1354' /><a href='#f1354' class='c015'><sup>[1354]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Many at</i> Rome<br/><i>embrace the Errors<br/>of</i> Origen.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Work, thus recommended,
was received with uncommon Applause at <i>Rome</i>, and the Sentiments
of <i>Origen</i> greedily embraced, and warmly maintained, by great Numbers
of the Clergy as well as the Laity, to whom <i>Origen</i> had till then
been, it seems, utterly unknown. This happened in the Time of
<i>Syricius</i>, who, either not suspecting <i>Ruffinus</i>, as he had not put his
Name to the Translation, or perhaps not judging him worthy of Censure
for barely relating the Sentiments of another, or supposing that,
agreeably to his Preface, he had suppressed whatever was wrong in the
original Work, gave him Letters of Communion at his Departure
from <i>Rome</i>: for he had no sooner published his Translation than he
left that City and returned to <i>Aquileia</i>. <i>Syricius</i> died soon after,
and <i>Anastasius</i> was no sooner chosen in his room, than the famous
<i>Roman</i> Matron <i>Marcella</i>, offended at the new Doctrines that began
to prevail in <i>Rome</i>, applied to him, pressing him to put a Stop to the
growing Evil, and at the same time accusing <i>Ruffinus</i> as the Author of
the Translation, to which alone it was owing<a id='r1355' /><a href='#f1355' class='c015'><sup>[1355]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Errors left in the<br/>Work, notwithstand-<br/>ing the Corrections<br/>made by the Trans-<br/>lator.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  To make good this
Charge, she produced some Copies corrected with <i>Ruffinus</i>’s own
Hand; and several Persons appeared, who, having by her means been
reclaimed from the Errors of <i>Origen</i>, owned they had been led into
them by the Disciples of <i>Ruffinus</i><a id='r1356' /><a href='#f1356' class='c015'><sup>[1356]</sup></a>. This <i>Jerom</i> cannot relate without
launching into the Praises of his Heroine <i>Marcella</i>, crying up her
Zeal, extolling her Courage and Resolution, in thus making head
against so numerous a Band, meaning the <i>Origenists</i> in <i>Rome</i>, while
the Clergy declined that Trouble, or rather promoted the Doctrines
they ought to have opposed. But elsewhere he will not allow Women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>under any Pretence whatsoever, to concern themselves in religious
Controversies. <i>To meddle in Disputes concerning Faith or Religion, is
not at all the Province</i> (says he, with the Words of St. <i>Paul</i>) <i>of silly
Women, laden with Sins, led away with divers Lusts, ever learning,
and never able to come to the Knowlege of the Truth</i><a id='r1357' /><a href='#f1357' class='c015'><sup>[1357]</sup></a>. But he
speaks here of <i>Melania</i>, who was no less attached to <i>Ruffinus</i> than
<i>Marcella</i> was to him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerom<i>’s Charge<br/>against</i> Ruffinus.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the <i>Periarchon</i> were contained, without all doubt, many unfound
and unwarrantable Notions, and <i>Ruffinus</i> corrected those only
that related to the Trinity. <i>He corrected</i>, says <i>Jerom</i>, <i>what</i> Origen
<i>had impiously written concerning the Trinity, being well apprised it
would have given great Offence at</i> Rome. <i>But as to his other Errors,
those especially concerning the Fall of the Angels, and the first
Man, the Resurrection, the World or Worlds of</i> Epicurus, <i>the Restoration
of all Things</i>, &amp;c. <i>he either left them, as he found them in
the Original, or confirmed them with Reasons borrowed from the
Comment of</i> Didymus, <i>an avowed Defender of</i> Origen. <i>Thus he
declared himself a Catholic with respect to the Trinity; that in other
Points the Reader might not be aware of him as an Heretic</i><a id='r1358' /><a href='#f1358' class='c015'><sup>[1358]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ruffinus<i>’s Answers</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In Answer to this Charge, <i>Ruffinus</i> declared, that it was never his
Intention to correct all the Errors that were ascribed to <i>Origen</i>; that
the Declaration he had made, in his Preface to the <i>Periarchon</i>, ought
to be restrained to those Errors only that related to the Trinity; and
that it was very uncharitable to judge of his Faith, from the Faith of
the Author he translated, and not from his own Words. He then
declares his Sentiments touching some particular Points, in which
<i>Origen</i> was thought to differ from the Church; adding, that where
<i>Origen</i> differed from the Catholic Church, he differed from <i>Origen</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jerom <i>condemns</i><br/>Origen, <i>and inveighs<br/>against</i> Ruffinus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Anastasius</i>, notwithstanding the Solicitations of <i>Marcella</i>, declined
either proceeding against <i>Ruffinus</i>, or censuring his Translation, till
Two Years after, when <i>Jerom</i>, in a new Version which he published
of the same Work, undertook to prove, that several Opinions of
<i>Origen</i> were truly heretical, and as such ought to be condemned by
the Church. As to <i>Ruffinus</i>, he inveighed bitterly against him, as
if he had translated that Work with no other View but to propagate
the Errors it contained. Thus began the famous Quarrel between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>these Two Writers, which occasioned no small Disturbance in the
Church, some siding with <i>Jerom</i> against <i>Ruffinus</i>, and others with
<i>Ruffinus</i> against <i>Jerom</i>. Among the former, the most sanguine were
<i>Theophilus</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Epiphanius</i> Bishop of <i>Constantia</i>
in the Island of <i>Cyprus</i>, and <i>Anastasius</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. <i>Theophilus</i>
not only condemned in a Council, which he summoned for that
Purpose, the Errors of <i>Origen</i>, but <i>Origen</i> himself, declaring him an
Heretic, and forbidding all under his Jurisdiction to read, or even
keep his Works by them; which is the first Instance we have of such
Prohibitions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Origen <i>condemned by</i> Anastasius <i>and sev-<br/>eral other Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> His Example was followed by <i>Epiphanius</i>, <i>Anastasius</i>,
<i>Venerius</i> Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, <i>Chromatius</i> Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>, and several
others. But some, and among the rest <i>John</i> Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
and <i>Chrysostom</i> then Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, disapproving the rash
Conduct of their Collegues, could by no means be induced to confirm
the Sentence they had pronounced; which <i>Epiphanius</i> resented
to such a Degree, that he immediately separated himself from their
Communion. <i>Sozomen</i> adds, that he even refused to pray for young
<i>Theodosius</i>, while he was dangerously ill, because his Mother <i>Eudoxia</i>
would not banish from <i>Constantinople</i> some Monks who had warmly
espoused the Cause of <i>Origen</i><a id='r1359' /><a href='#f1359' class='c015'><sup>[1359]</sup></a>. <i>Ruffinus</i> ranks <i>Epiphanius</i> among
those Plagiaries, who, borrowing from <i>Origen</i> all they said or writ,
cried down his Works, in order to deter others from reading them,
and consequently from discovering, that what was admired in them
was not their own<a id='r1360' /><a href='#f1360' class='c015'><sup>[1360]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ruffinus <i>is summoned<br/>to</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Origen</i> being thus condemned as an Heretic, near 150 Years after
his Death, <i>Anastasius</i>, at the Instigation of <i>Marcella</i>, <i>Pammachius</i>,
<i>Oceanus</i>, and some other of <i>Jerom</i>’s Friends in <i>Rome</i>, writ to <i>Ruffinus</i>,
complaining of his Translation, and summoning him to appear,
and give an Account of his Faith. In Answer to this Letter, <i>Ruffinus</i>
sent him a Confession of Faith intirely agreeable to that of the Catholic
Church, adding, that he held no other; that his Faith had been
sufficiently tried in the Persecution of <i>Valens</i>; and that, as to the Translation
of <i>Origen</i>’s Work, he had there neither approved nor disapproved,
but barely related, the Sentiments of that Writer. He modestly
declined complying with the Summons calling him to <i>Rome</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and concluded with declaring, that the Faith of the <i>Roman</i> Church
and his were one and the same<a id='r1362' /><a href='#f1362' class='c015'><sup>[1362]</sup></a><a id='rN42' /><a href='#fN42' class='c015'><sup>[N42]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN42'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN42'>N42</a>. The chief Errors of <i>Origen</i> were
concerning the Trinity, the Resurrection
of the Body, the Eternity of Hell-Torments,
and the Origin of Souls. If his
Works were not interpolated by the Heretics,
as <i>Ruffinus</i> pretended they were, it
is no easy Matter to determine what was
his real Opinion with respect to the Trinity;
for in some Passages he seems to acknowlege
an Equality, and in others to establish
an Inequality, between the Father and the
Son. As to the Resurrection, he was accused
of not believing, that the Body, at
least the same Body, was to rise from the
Dead. He denied the Eternity of Hell-Torments,
and held, that even the Devils
would repent in the End, and be saved. He
maintained the Souls to have been created
before the World; to have been confined
to the Bodies, which they animated, as so
many Prisons, to <a id='corr281A.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='expatie'>expiate</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_281A.21'><ins class='correction' title='expatie'>expiate</ins></a></span> there the Sins
which they had committed; to be in perpetual
Motion passing from one Body to
another, and at last to become Angels.
With the Three last Errors chiefly <i>Ruffinus</i>
was charged by St. <i>Jerom</i>; and it
was to clear himself from such an Imputation,
that, in his Answer to <i>Anastasius</i>
summoning him to <i>Rome</i>, he declared his
Belief with respect to those Articles, styling
his Answer on that Account an <i>Apology</i>.
As to the Trinity, those whom they called
<i>Origenists</i>, were allowed, even by their
Enemies, to be quite orthodox in their
Belief of that Mystery. Touching the
Resurrection, <i>Ruffinus</i> declared and explained
his Faith in such clear Terms as
ought to have left no room, even for
St. <i>Jerom</i>, to arraign him on that Head.
He expressed himself in a manner no less
orthodox with respect to the Eternity of
the Pains of Hell. But, as to the Origin
of Souls, he owns himself to be quite at a
Loss what to think, and what to determine,
on that Subject, since no particular Opinion
had been yet settled by the Church, and
the Ecclesiastical Writers disagreed in that
Point among themselves; some believing,
with <i>Tertullian</i> and <i>Lactantius</i>, the Souls
to have been formed with the Bodies; and
others maintaining, with <i>Origen</i>, that they
were all created before the World: as to
himself, he declared, that he held nothing
for certain but what he was taught by the
Church, <i>viz.</i> that the Souls as well as the
Bodies proceeded from God<a id='rN42.1' /><a href='#fN42.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This <i>Jerom</i>
called a false, artful, and imposing
Confession, as if <i>Ruffinus</i> did not believe
what he professed in the most solemn Manner
to believe; and <i>Anastasius</i>, judging of
his Faith not from his own Words, but
from those of <i>Jerom</i>, separated himself
from his Communion.</p>

<p class='c001'>I cannot help observing here, that <i>Jerom</i>,
whom nothing now will satisfy but the Condemnation
of <i>Origen</i>, used a few Years before
to inveigh with the same Gall and Bitterness
against the Enemies of that Writer as he
does now against his Friends, condemning
with as much Acrimony those who accused
him, as he now condemns those who excuse
him. <i>Origen</i> had been condemned in his
Life-time by <i>Demetrius</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>,
and by several other Bishops: and <i>Jerom</i>,
after telling us, in speaking of the
Judgment that was given against him, that
he had written more Books than others had
time to read; and that in the Number of
his Volumes he had surpassed <i>Varro</i>, and the
other most eloquent Writers both <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Latin</i>; adds, <i>But what Reward did he receive
for so much Toil and Labour? He was
condemned by the Bishop</i> Demetrius; <i>and,
if we except the Bishops of</i> Palæstine, Arabia,
Ph&oelig;nicia, <i>and</i> Achaia, <i>he was condemned by
all the rest. Even</i> Rome <i>assembled her Senate
against him, not because he taught any
new Doctrines, or held any heretical Opinions,
which those who snarl at him, like so
many mad Dogs, would fain make us believe;
but because they could not bear the
bright Rays of his Eloquence and Knowlege,
and were forced to be dumb when he spoke</i>.
This Passage is quoted by <i>Ruffinus</i>, and
<i>Jerom</i> himself owns it to have been copied
from his Letter to <i>Paula</i><a id='rN42.2' /><a href='#fN42.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the Senate that <i>Rome</i> assembled
against <i>Origen</i>, <i>Jerom</i> meant, no doubt,
the Bishop and Clergy of that City: and that
he made no Account of their Judgment,
sufficiently appears from the contemptuous
and ironical Manner he speaks of it. However,
that Father is brought in by <i>Baronius</i>
as an Evidence for <i>Infallibility</i>, on account
of the Regard which he afterwards paid to
the Judgment of <i>Anastasius</i>, styling it <i>a decisive
Sentence</i>. But <i>Jerom</i> had then changed
his Opinion; and <i>Anastasius</i> only condemned
what he had condemned before; so
that from the great Regard which <i>Jerom</i>
shewed on that Occasion for the Judgment
of <i>Anastasius</i>, <i>Baronius</i> can at most conclude,
that he thought the Popes infallible
when they agreed with him; for that he
thought them fallible when they disagreed
with him, is manifest from his not acquiescing
in the Judgment of another Pope
condemning <i>Origen</i>, when he himself had
not yet condemned him.</p>

nay, he was the more guilty of the Two.
For he had not only translated many of
<i>Origen</i>’s Works, containing Errors no less
repugnant to the Catholic Truths than any
in the <i>Periarchon</i>, but had besides filled his
Comments on the Scripture, especially on
the Epistle to the <i>Ephesians</i>, with the worst
of Origen’s Errors, <i>viz.</i> with those relating
to the Resurrection of the Body, to the
Pre-existence of the Souls, and to the Duration
of Hell-Torments, as is manifest
from the many Passages quoted by <i>Ruffinus</i>
out of the Comments of that Father. <i>Jerom</i>
found great Fault with <i>Ruffinus</i>, for
not confuting the Errors which he translated;
concluding from thence, that he held
the same Doctrines: and yet he was himself
so far from confuting in his Comments any
of <i>Origen</i>’s erroneous Opinions, that on the
contrary he often delivered them in such
manner as made many, and St. <i>Austin</i>
among the rest, believe them to be his
own<a id='rN43.1' /><a href='#fN43.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Nay, in one Place he seems to
own, that he held some of <i>Origin</i>’s Errors<a id='rN43.2' /><a href='#fN43.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>:
but ends what he there writes of
him thus; <i>If you believe me, I never was
an</i> Origenist; <i>but if you absolutely insist upon
my having been one, I now tell you, that I
am so no more; and it is to convince you of

very different from that which we read in <i>Baronius</i>, introducing his

though <i>Jerom</i> tells us, in express Terms, that <i>Anastasius</i> followed
the Example of <i>Theophilus</i>; that he condemned in the West, what
had before been condemned in the East<a id='r1365' /><a href='#f1365' class='c015'><sup>[1365]</sup></a>; and that <i>Rome</i> and all <i>Italy</i>

Books, and exhorting them to follow his Example<a id='r1367' /><a href='#f1367' class='c015'><sup>[1367]</sup></a>. It was by this
Letter that <i>Anastasius</i> was induced to condemn <i>Origen</i>: For what else
could <i>Jerom</i> mean by saying, that <i>Rome</i> and <i>Italy</i> were, by the
Letters of <i>Theophilus</i>, delivered from the Errors of <i>Origen</i>? <i>Baronius</i>
could not but know, that the Letter of <i>Theophilus</i> was addressed
to all the Catholic Bishops, since it is styled by <i>Theophilus</i>
himself, in a Letter he writ to <i>Epiphanius</i><a id='r1368' /><a href='#f1368' class='c015'><sup>[1368]</sup></a>, and by <i>Epiphanius</i>,

is now understood, did not cut him off from the Communion of the

him in this Sense was by the Canons vested in his own Bishop;
and it is manifest from <i>Jerom</i>, that <i>Chromatius</i>, then Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>,
continued to communicate with him after <i>Anastasius</i> had renounced

in his Letter to <i>John</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, was his having translated <i>Origen</i>
into the <i>Latin</i> Tongue, without pointing out his Errors, or offering
any Arguments to confute them. Thence he was by <i>Jerom</i> induced

that he embraced nothing as Truth, that any-ways differed
from the received Doctrines of the Catholic Church: nay, he was so
far from defending any of <i>Origen</i>’s Errors, which seemed to him repugnant
to the Catholic Truths, that in the Apology he composed in
Defence of that Writer, as well as in the Preface which he prefixed to
his Translation, he undertook to prove, that those Errors were not his,
but had been maliciously inserted into his Works, either by his Enemies
to eclipse his Reputation, or by Heretics, who had fathered upon
him their own Doctrines, with a View of recommending them to the

had for a Man of <i>Origen</i>’s Piety and Learning, either ascribed to others
the Errors they found in his Works, or excused them, by putting on
his Words the most charitable Construction they could bear. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Origen <i>excused by<br/>some of the Fathers,<br/>and once by</i> Jerom<br/><i>himself</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Jerom</i>
himself had been formerly one of <i>Origen</i>’s greatest Admirers, had
translated above Seventy of his Books, and thought he could not employ
his Time better than in enriching the <i>Latin</i> Tongue with the
Works of <i>the best Writer and first Doctor of the Church after the
Apostles</i><a id='r1379' /><a href='#f1379' class='c015'><sup>[1379]</sup></a>, as he then styled him. As <i>Ruffinus</i>, in his Translation
of the <i>Periarchon</i>, endeavoured to excuse the Errors of <i>Origen</i>, so had
<i>Jerom</i> done before him in translating his other Works, chusing rather
to <i>veil and excuse</i>, than expose the Faults of one whom in other respects
he so much admired<a id='r1380' /><a href='#f1380' class='c015'><sup>[1380]</sup></a>. But this Admiration being afterwards
changed into an open and avowed Enmity, <i>the first Doctor of the

but an <i>impious Writer</i>; all who stood up in his Defence were arraigned
of the same <i>pestilential Doctrines</i>; and what was found amiss in his

<div class='footnote' id='fN45'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN45'>N45</a>. Some of the Fathers would not allow
even his Doctrine concerning the Trinity
to be heterodox. For some Passages being
quoted out of his Works by the <i>Arians</i> to
confirm their Opinions, <i>Basil</i> and <i>Nazianzen</i>
undertook to prove, from other Passages,
that his Sentiments with respect to
the Trinity were quite orthodox; and that
the <i>Arians</i> had either out of Malice misinterpreted,
or out of Ignorance misunderstood
his Meaning, not being capable of
fathoming the Depth of his Thoughts<a id='rN45.1' /><a href='#fN45.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
It must be owned, that <i>Origen</i>, in several
Places, speaks of the Trinity agreeably to
the Sentiments of the Church, acknowleging
<i>the Son to have been from the Beginning
in the Father; to be the Image of the
Father; to have been begotten by him from
all Eternity; to be the Wisdom of God; to
be God, though not the Source and Origin of
the Divinity, as the Father, whom on that
Account he styles</i> Autotheos; <i>to be above all
Creatures; to have the same Power as the
Father, and to deserve the same Honour and
Worship</i>. But elsewhere he uses Expressions
that can no-way bear an orthodox Sense,
<i>viz.</i> that <i>the</i> Word <i>is an Hypostasis different
from the Father</i>; meaning by the Word
<i>Hypostasis</i>, Nature and Substance; <i>that the
Father and Son are One by Concord and Union;
that the Son is not properly God, but
called God, because he is the Image of the
Divinity; that the Word and the Holy Ghost
were made by the Father; that the Father is
greater than the Son; that the Son is inferior
to the Father, though far above all Creatures,
as the Ray of the Sun is inferior to the Sun</i>;
and lastly, <i>that the Son is the Minister of
the Father</i>. In these Passages is contained
a very different Doctrine from that which
is laid down in those I have quoted above:
and hence some of the Friends of <i>Origen</i>,
and among the rest <i>Ruffinus</i>, concluded the
latter Passages to have been foisted in by the
<i>Arians</i>, denying the Divinity of the Word;
while others, allowing them to be <i>Origen</i>’s,
undertook to explain them in a Catholic
Sense, in Opposition to the <i>Arians</i> confirming
their Doctrine with the Authority of so
eminent a Writer. But his Enemies, attending
only to the Passages where he seemed
to establish an Inequality in the Trinity,
not only condemned him as an Heretic, but
all who stood up in his Defence, or attempted
to interpret his Words in a Catholic
Sense.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>But what seems most of all surprising, and quite unaccountable, in
the Conduct of that Father, is, that though he had with so much
Noise procured <i>Origen</i> to be condemned as an Heretic, and his Books
to be prohibited, particularly his <i>Periarchon</i>, or, as some will have it,
the <i>Periarchon</i> alone, as containing most of his heretical Tenets; yet,
in a private Letter to <i>Paulinus</i>, he refers him to that very Piece for
the Decision of some Questions of the greatest Importance<a id='r1381' /><a href='#f1381' class='c015'><sup>[1381]</sup></a>. But to

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Bishops of</i> Africa <i>apply to</i> Anastasius <i>and</i> Venerius <i>of</i> Milan.</div>

<p class='c001'>The same Year 401. in which <i>Origen</i> was condemned, the Churches
of <i>Africa</i> being greatly distressed for want of Ecclesiastics, the Bishops
of the Province of <i>Carthage</i>, assembling under <i>Aurelius</i> Bishop of
that City, resolved to dispatch one of their Body into <i>Italy</i> to acquaint
<i>Anastasius</i>, and <i>Venerius</i> Bishop of <i>Milan</i>, with the Condition of the
<i>African</i> Churches, and implore their Assistance<a id='r1382' /><a href='#f1382' class='c015'><sup>[1382]</sup></a>. Which of the
Bishops was charged with this Legation, or what Success attended it,
we are no-where told. But as <i>Paulinus</i>, who afterwards writ the
Life of St. <i>Ambrose</i>, and belonged to the Church of <i>Milan</i>, was at
this Time sent into <i>Africa</i>, and continued there, some have not improbably
conjectured, that <i>Venerius</i> at least assisted his Collegues in
<i>Africa</i> with a Supply of as many Ecclesiastics as he could spare.
<i>Baronius</i> supposes <i>Anastasius</i> to have relieved those Churches with
the like Supply; but this Supposition he builds upon the paternal
Care which <i>Anastasius</i> had, as <i>universal Pastor</i>, of all the Catholic
Churches<a id='r1383' /><a href='#f1383' class='c015'><sup>[1383]</sup></a>, which is building on a false Foundation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Anastasius <i>advises<br/>the Bishops of</i> Africa<br/><i>not to dissemble the<br/>Cruelties of the</i><br/>Donatists.</div>

<p class='c001'>The same Year another Council was held at <i>Carthage</i>, consisting of
all the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>; and <i>Aurelius</i>, who presided in this, as he
had done in the former, opened it with reading a Letter from <i>Anastasius</i>,
exhorting the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> no longer to dissemble the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Cruelties of the <i>Donatists</i>, who continued to use with great Barbarity
the Catholic Bishops and Clergy<a id='r1384' /><a href='#f1384' class='c015'><sup>[1384]</sup></a>. The Fathers of the Council
returned <i>Anastasius</i> Thanks for his Advice; but, not thinking it quite
agreeable to the true Spirit of Christianity, they declined complying
with it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Who refuse to comply<br/>with his Advice.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They knew that their Persecutors, had they complained of

before, by the Emperors <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Honorius</i><a id='r1385' /><a href='#f1385' class='c015'><sup>[1385]</sup></a>. They therefore

at so dear a Rate<a id='r1386' /><a href='#f1386' class='c015'><sup>[1386]</sup></a>. In the same Council it was decreed among other
things, that such of the <i>Donatist</i> Clergy, as should return to the
Church, might be admitted, if the Bishop, who received them,
thought it expedient, to the same Rank, which they had enjoyed before
their Conversion. As a Decree had been lately enacted by <i>Anastasius</i>,
and the other <i>Italian</i> Bishops, excluding converted Heretics
from the Catholic Clergy<a id='r1387' /><a href='#f1387' class='c015'><sup>[1387]</sup></a>; it was to acquaint them with the Motives
which had prompted the Fathers assembled at <i>Carthage</i>, to admit
the <i>Donatists</i>, that <i>Aurelius</i> and his Collegues writ to <i>Anastasius</i>;
and not to beg of him a Dispensation in favour of the converted

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'>On the Demise of <i>Anastasius</i>, <i>Innocent</i> was immediately, and
with one Consent, chosen by the Clergy, and the People<a id='r1392' /><a href='#f1392' class='c015'><sup>[1392]</sup></a>.
He was, according to <i>Anastasius</i><a id='r1393' /><a href='#f1393' class='c015'><sup>[1393]</sup></a>, a Native of <i>Albano</i>, and the Son
of another <i>Innocent</i>; but, according to <i>Jerom</i>, both the Son and
Successor of <i>Anastasius</i><a id='r1394' /><a href='#f1394' class='c015'><sup>[1394]</sup></a>. <i>Theodoret</i> styles him a Man of great Address,
and a lively Genius<a id='r1395' /><a href='#f1395' class='c015'><sup>[1395]</sup></a>; <i>Prosper</i>, a worthy Successor of St. <i>Peter</i><a id='r1396' /><a href='#f1396' class='c015'><sup>[1396]</sup></a>;
and <i>Austin</i> distinguishes him, after his Death, with the Title of
the <i>Blessed</i> Innocent<a id='r1397' /><a href='#f1397' class='c015'><sup>[1397]</sup></a>. <i>Orosius</i> says, that God withdrew that holy
Bishop from <i>Rome</i>, when the City was taken, as he did <i>Lot</i> from
<i>Sodom</i><a id='r1398' /><a href='#f1398' class='c015'><sup>[1398]</sup></a>; and <i>Jerom</i>, in writing to <i>Demetrias</i>, exhorts her to adhere
steadily to the Faith of <i>Innocent</i><a id='r1399' /><a href='#f1399' class='c015'><sup>[1399]</sup></a>. <i>Austin</i>, in the Letter he writ to
him in the Name of the Council of <i>Milevum</i>, ascribes his Election
to a particular Providence; and adds, that the Fathers of the Council
thought it a Duty incumbent upon them to suggest to him what
might be done for the Good of the Church, since they could not
think him capable of hearing any thing of that Nature with Contempt
or Indifference<a id='r1400' /><a href='#f1400' class='c015'><sup>[1400]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He writes to</i> Anysius<br/><i>of</i> Thessalonica.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i> was no sooner chosen and ordained, than he writ to
<i>Anysius</i> of <i>Thessalonica</i>, acquainting him with his Election, and
charging him, as his Three immediate Predecessors had done, with
the Care of the Churches of <i>East Illyricum</i><a id='r1401' /><a href='#f1401' class='c015'><sup>[1401]</sup></a>. In the End of the following
Year 403. the Emperor <i>Honorius</i> visited the City of <i>Rome</i>;
and, during his Stay there, <i>Innocent</i> went frequently to wait on him,
in order to obtain, in Behalf of some Bishops, and other Ecclesiastics,
an Exemption from executing certain Civil Offices hereditary in their
Families. He succeeded in his Suit; but it cost him a great deal of
Trouble and Uneasiness<a id='r1402' /><a href='#f1402' class='c015'><sup>[1402]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Innocent<i>’s Letter to</i><br/>Victricius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Victricius</i> Bishop of <i>Rouen</i>, who happened
to be then at <i>Rome</i>, having applied to him for Information,
with respect to the Practice and Discipline of the <i>Roman</i> Church,
<i>Innocent</i>, to gratify him, and <i>that he might not seem to approve, by</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span><i>his Silence, the Abuses that prevailed in some Churches</i>, sent him a
<i>Book of Rules</i>, as he styled it, containing several Regulations, which
had been originally established, says he, by the Authority of the Apostles
and Fathers, but were now, in many Places, either quite unknown,
or utterly neglected. He therefore intreats <i>Victricius</i> to communicate
them to the neighbouring Churches and Bishops, that they
might be acquainted with the Discipline of the <i>Roman</i> Church, and
conform to it in instructing the new-converted Christians<a id='r1403' /><a href='#f1403' class='c015'><sup>[1403]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Articles it con-<br/>tains.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This <cite>Book of Rules</cite> contains Thirteen Regulations relating to different
Points of Discipline, whereof the First forbids, and declares uncanonical,
the Ordination of Bishops without the Knowlege and Approbation
of their Metropolitans. The Second excludes from the
Clerical Order such as have served, or shall continue to serve, in
War after Baptism. The Third orders all Differences and Disputes,
arising among the Ecclesiastics, to be decided by the Bishops of the
Provinces, <i>saving the Rights of the</i> Roman <i>Church</i><a id='rN47' /><a href='#fN47' class='c015'><sup>[N47]</sup></a>; and commands
those to be deposed who shall recur to other Tribunals, except
in Causes of the greatest Importance, when, after the Bishops
have given Sentence, Recourse may be had to the Apostolical See,
pursuant to the Order of the Council, meaning, no doubt, the
Council of <i>Sardica</i><a id='r1404' /><a href='#f1404' class='c015'><sup>[1404]</sup></a>. The Three next relate to those who shall have
married a Widow, a Woman that has been divorced, or a second Wife,
either before or after Baptism; and they are all alike declared incapable
of being ever admitted among the Clergy. The Seventh forbids
Bishops to ordain Clerks of another Church, without the Permission
of their own Bishops, or to admit those to serve one Church, who
have been deposed in another. The Eighth allows the <i>Novatians</i>
and <i>Donatists</i>, who return to the Church, to be readmitted by the
bare Imposition of Hands; but subjects those to a long Penance, who
had quitted the Church to be rebaptized by them. The Ninth relates
to the Celibacy of the Priests and Deacons, who are debarred by
it from all Commerce with their Wives, after Ordination. The inferior
Clergy were allowed to marry; but <i>Innocent</i>, by the Tenth Article
of the present Letter, excepts those who, before they were admitted
among the Clergy, had lived in Monasteries, and professed
Continence there; it being fit, says he, they should observe in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>higher Rank what they had observed when only Monks. In the same
Article he observes, that those, who had lost their Virginity before
Marriage, did not receive the Blessing of the Church when they afterwards
married; and that it was the antient Practice of the Church,
that such as had lost it before Baptism, should promise, before they
were admitted to the Clerical Order, never to marry. The Eleventh
forbids those to be ordained, who were not exempted from all Civil
Offices and Employments, such Offices diverting them from the Functions
of the Priesthood, and sometimes obliging them to exhibit
Shews and public Sports, of which the Devil was, without all Doubt,
the Author and Promoter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Innocent <i>thinks the<br/>Marriage of a Woman<br/>with another Man<br/>valid, while her Hus-<br/>band is still alive</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Twelfth forbids Women, who have
married a Second Husband, their First being still alive, to be admitted
to Repentance, or allowed to do Penance, till one of the Two
dies. The same Discipline is to be observed, according to this Article,
with respect to the Virgins, who, after consecrating their Virginity
to <i>Jesus Christ</i>, shall, either by a public Marriage, or by private
Fornication, violate the Faith they had pledged to their immortal
Spouse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The unchristian Sever-<br/>ity of one of these<br/>Articles ill excused<br/>by</i> Baronius.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i><a id='r1405' /><a href='#f1405' class='c015'><sup>[1405]</sup></a>, to answer the Objections which some <i>Innovators</i>, as
he is pleased to style them, have offered against the unchristian Severity
of this Article, tells us, that the Repentance of such a Virgin
can by no means be sincere, so long as she continues with the Man
she married; which is quite foreign to the Purpose, since <i>Innocent</i>
excludes her from Repentance, not only so long as she lives with
him, but so long as he lives. <i>Innocent</i> knew what <i>Baronius</i> seems
not to have known; <i>viz.</i> that the Marriage of Virgins, however
solemnly consecrated, held good, even according to the Practice of
the <i>Roman</i> Church<a id='r1406' /><a href='#f1406' class='c015'><sup>[1406]</sup></a>; and, consequently, that they could not abandon
their Husbands; and hence he would not admit them to Repentance,
or the Participation of the Sacred Mysteries, till the Death of
their Husbands; which was keeping them, as it were, in a State of
Excommunication, without any possible Means of redeeming themselves
from it. And it is this uncharitable Severity, which some Divines
of the <i>Reformed Churches</i> have deservedly blamed. <i>Baronius</i>
stigmatizes such Marriages with the Name of <i>Adultery</i>; but he confounds
the Time of <i>Innocent</i> with his own; for, in his Time, the
Vow of Chastity was declared a true Marriage; and, consequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>every subsequent Marriage void and null; but, in <i>Innocent</i>’s Time,
the Marriage of a sacred Virgin was held valid, though commonly
deemed sinful. Whether it be sinful or no, or whether a Vow of
that kind can be lawfully made, I shall not take upon me to determine
here; but I am very confident, that of most Persons, who debar
themselves by a solemn Vow from ever marrying, we may say,
with the Fathers of the Eighth Council of <i>Toledo</i>, that <i>they had better
break a Vow, which they had rashly made, than fill up, by observing
it, the Measure of their Sins</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to return to the Letter: The Thirteenth and last Article will
have those Virgins to do Penance for some time, who shall marry
after having promised to live Virgins, though they had not yet received
the Sacred Veil<a id='r1407' /><a href='#f1407' class='c015'><sup>[1407]</sup></a>. This Letter has been inserted by <i>Dionysius
Exiguus</i>, in his Code of the <i>Roman</i> Church, and is quoted by
the Second Council of <i>Tours</i>, held in 567<a id='r1408' /><a href='#f1408' class='c015'><sup>[1408]</sup></a>. and by several other

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN48'>N48</a>. And yet some have been induced by
the Date it bears, to question its Authenticity.
For it is dated the 15th of <i>February</i>
404. Now, it is manifest, say they,
from the Letter itself, that <i>Victricius</i> was at
<i>Rome</i> while the Emperor <i>Honorius</i> was
there; and it is no less certain, that <i>Honorius</i>
did not arrive at <i>Rome</i> till the Month
of <i>December</i> 403. If therefore <i>Victricius</i>
was at <i>Rome</i> in <i>December</i> 403. it is not at
all probable, that <i>Innocent</i> should have written
to him on the 15th of <i>February</i> 404. To
solve this Difficulty, some suppose <i>Victricius</i>
to have applied to <i>Innocent</i>, while he was
still at <i>Rome</i>; and <i>Innocent</i>, instead of informing
him, as he might, by Word of
Mouth, to have given him in Writing the
desired Instructions, that, having thus more
Weight, they might the more readily be
complied with by other Bishops. But it is
manifest, from <i>Innocent</i>’s Words, that his
Letter was an Answer to one from <i>Victricius</i>;
and we cannot well suppose <i>Victricius</i>,
who was at <i>Rome</i> in <i>December</i>, to have returned
to <i>Rouen</i>, to have written from thence
to <i>Innocent</i>, and <i>Innocent</i> to have returned
him so full an Answer by the 15th of the
following <i>January</i>. We may conclude the
Year to have been, by some Mistake, altered,
and 404. inserted in the Date instead
of 405. since the Letter could not be
written earlier, as I have just observed, than
the Month of <i>January</i> (if <i>January</i> was the
true Month) of the latter Year; and we
have no Reason to think it was written
later. The Mistake as to the Year might
have been occasioned by the Transcriber’s
omitting P. C. <i>Post Consulatum Honorii</i>,
and thereby confounding the Year of the
Emperor’s Sixth Consulship 404. with the
Year after it 405.--Such Omissions frequently
occur, and have led Writers, not
aware of them, into great Mistakes, in
point of Chronology, or made them suspect,
nay, and condemn, as spurious, the most
authentic Pieces of History. This Letter,
in some Editions, bears no Date; and F.
<i>Labbé</i> assures us, that he has seen a manuscript
Copy of it, in which the Date was
wanting. Some therefore suppose the Date
to have been afterwards added, nay, and
the whole Conclusion of the Letter. For
<i>Innocent</i> closes it by saying, that the Observance
of the Rules it contains will banish
all Ambition among the Bishops, compose
all Differences, prevent all Schisms, and
leave no room for the Devil to insult the
Flock of Christ. A Conclusion taken probably
from some other Piece, and not at all
adapted or applicable, with Truth, to this.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Letter of the Coun-<br/>cil of</i> Carthage <i>to</i><br/>Innocent.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>In the Year 404. <i>Austin</i> writ to <i>Innocent</i>, in the Name of the
Bishops assembled in Council at <i>Carthage</i>, intreating him to apply to
<i>Honorius</i> for new Laws against the <i>Donatists</i>; whose Cruelties towards
the Orthodox, if not magnified by <i>Austin</i><a id='r1410' /><a href='#f1410' class='c015'><sup>[1410]</sup></a>, are scarce to be
matched in History. The Emperor hearkened to <i>Innocent</i>’s Remonstrances,
and severe Laws being issued against them, they began by
that means to be convinced of their Errors, and to return daily in
great Numbers to the Unity of the Church. This is what we read
in one of <i>Austin</i>’s Letters<a id='r1411' /><a href='#f1411' class='c015'><sup>[1411]</sup></a>; for the <i>Donatists</i>, as he would make us
believe, finding themselves persecuted, began to inquire, which they
had never done before, into the Grounds of the Religion, for which
they suffered. This Inquiry had the desired Effect; their Eyes were
opened; they discovered the Errors of their Sect; and, being sensible
of their Folly in foregoing any temporal Advantage, or exposing
themselves to the least Inconvenience, for the sake of such a Religion,
they sincerely abjured it, and zealously embraced the Catholic Faith.
An ingenious Term, I must own, to excuse, nay, and to authorize
and sanctify, the greatest Barbarities! But daily Experience teaches us,
that Persecution has a contrary Effect, and that the more Men are
persecuted, the more obstinately they adhere to the Opinions, however
absurd, for which they suffer; witness the great Number of
Martyrs which almost every Church, as well as the Catholic, can
boast of. And, where it has not that Effect, the most it can do is
to make Men become Hypocrites, and profess a Religion they do not
believe; but scarce ever changes their Hearts, or brings any to a sincere
and efficacious Assent to a Faith which is thus violently forced
on their Minds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent <i>writes to<br/>the Bishops of</i> Spain.</div>

<p class='c001'>About the same time, or not long after, <i>Innocent</i> writ to the
Bishops of <i>Spain</i>, and the chief Articles of his Letter were: 1. That
they ought to cut off from their Communion such of their Brethren
as refused to communicate with <i>Symphosius</i>, <i>Dictinius</i>, and other
Bishops, who, having renounced the Errors of <i>Priscillian</i>, had been
readmitted to the Communion of the Church by the Council held
at <i>Toledo</i>, in the Year 400<a id='r1412' /><a href='#f1412' class='c015'><sup>[1412]</sup></a>. 2. That those Bishops should be deposed
who had been ordained without the Knowlege or Consent of their
Metropolitan. 3. That such as presumed to ordain against the Canons
should be likewise deposed, and all who had been thus ordained
by them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chrysostom <i>Bishop<br/>of</i> Constantinople<br/><i>recurs to</i> Innocent.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span><i>Chrysostom</i>, the celebrated Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, having been
unjustly deposed in 403 and driven from his See by <i>Theophilus</i>
Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, and the Council <i>ad Quercum</i>, or at <i>the Oak</i>,
near <i>Chalcedon</i>, had, upon his Return to <i>Constantinople</i>, insisted upon
a Council being summoned, to make his Innocence the more
plainly appear to the World. This <i>Theophilus</i>, and the Bishops of
his Party, not only strenuously opposed, but, by the great Interest
they had at Court, prevailed upon the Emperor <i>Arcadius</i> to drive
him from <i>Constantinople</i> a Second time, and banish him to <i>Cucusus</i>,
an inhospitable Place in <i>Cilicia</i>. The News of these last Proceedings
had not yet reached <i>Rome</i>, when <i>Theophilus</i> sent one of his Lectors
with a Letter to <i>Innocent</i>, acquainting him, that he had deposed
<i>Chrysostom</i>. As, in this Letter, <i>Theophilus</i> observed an intire Silence
with respect to the Motives that had prompted him to take such a
Step, <i>Innocent</i> prudently forbore returning him an Answer. There
happened to be then at <i>Rome</i> a Deacon of the Church of <i>Constantinople</i>,
who, hearing what <i>Theophilus</i> had written, went immediately,
and warned <i>Innocent</i> to be upon his Guard, intreating him, at the
same time, not to proceed but with the utmost Caution, in so nice
and important an Affair, and assuring him, that the Truth could not
remain long undiscovered. Accordingly, in Three Days, <i>Pansovius</i>,
and Three other Bishops, arrived at <i>Rome</i>, with Three Letters for
<i>Innocent</i>; <i>viz.</i> one from <i>Chrysostom</i> himself, another from the Bishops
of his Communion, and the Third from the whole Clergy of
<i>Constantinople</i>. <i>Chrysostom</i>, in his Letter, which is still to be seen in
his Works, and in those of <i>Palladius</i>, who writ the History of his
Persecution, after giving <i>Innocent</i> an Account of the Storm his Enemies
had raised against him, intreats him to declare such wicked
Proceedings void and null, to pronounce all who had any Share in
them punishable, according to the Ecclesiastical Laws, and to continue
to him the Marks of his Charity and Communion. In the Title and
Close of the Letter, he addresses himself to one, but every-where
else to more Persons, the Letter having been written, as appears from
the Copy in <i>Palladius</i><a id='r1413' /><a href='#f1413' class='c015'><sup>[1413]</sup></a>, not to <i>Innocent</i> alone, but to him, to <i>Venerius</i>
of <i>Milan</i>, and <i>Chromatius</i> of <i>Aquileia</i>, Bishops of the Three
chief Sees in the West.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent<i>’s Answer<br/>to</i> Chrysostom<i>’s Let-<br/>ter</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i>, acting with his usual Prudence and Circumspection, in
his Answer to the above-mentioned Letters, declared, that he admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the Bishops of both Parties to his Communion, from which
he could exclude no Man till he was lawfully judged and condemned;
and that therefore, to compose all Differences, and leave no room
for Complaints on either Side, it was fit a Council should be assembled,
consisting of the Western as well as the Eastern Bishops. The
other Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, to whom <i>Chrysostom</i> had written, returned
much the same Answer<a id='r1414' /><a href='#f1414' class='c015'><sup>[1414]</sup></a>, following therein the Advice, which <i>Chrysostom</i>
himself had given to the Bishops of his Party; <i>viz.</i> that they
should communicate with his Enemies, to prevent Divisions in the
Church, but not sign his Condemnation, because he did not think
himself guilty<a id='r1415' /><a href='#f1415' class='c015'><sup>[1415]</sup></a>. <i>Innocent</i>’s Answer to <i>Theophilus</i> was in Words to
the same Effect. His Letter to <i>Chrysostom</i> was carried into the East
by <i>Demetrius</i> Bishop of <i>Pessinus</i>, who took care to shew it every-where,
to the end it might be every-where known, that the <i>Roman</i>
Church still communicated with that holy Bishop<a id='r1416' /><a href='#f1416' class='c015'><sup>[1416]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theophilus <i>writes to</i><br/>Innocent.</div>

<p class='c001'>A few Days after <i>Innocent</i> had answered <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Letter, <i>Petrus</i>,
one of <i>Theophilus</i>’s Presbyters, and <i>Martyrius</i> Deacon of the
Church of <i>Constantinople</i>, arrived at <i>Rome</i>, with Letters from <i>Theophilus</i>,
and the Acts of <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Deposition by the Council <i>ad
Quercum</i>. From these it appeared, that the Council had consisted of
Thirty-six Bishops, whereof Twenty-nine were <i>Egyptians</i>, and over
these <i>Theophilus</i> had, as their Metropolitan, too great an Influence;
that <i>Chrysostom</i> had been condemned without being heard, and that
nothing had been laid to his Charge, deserving so severe and exemplary
a Punishment. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Innocent<i>'s Answer to</i> Theophilus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Innocent</i> therefore, having read them, with the
utmost Indignation, answered <i>Theophilus</i> in a few Words; that he
was determined, as he had notified to him by his former Letter, to
communicate both with him and his Brother <i>John</i>; that he could
by no means depart from the Communion of the latter, till he was
lawfully judged and condemned; that a Council was to be soon
held, before which it was incumbent upon <i>Theophilus</i> to make good
his Charge, and the Steps he had hitherto taken, by the Canons and
Decrees of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, since the <i>Roman</i> Church admitted
no others<a id='r1417' /><a href='#f1417' class='c015'><sup>[1417]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Letters from the<br/>Bishops of</i> Chry-<br/>sostom<i>’s Party to</i><br/>Innocent.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> With this Letter <i>Petrus</i> and <i>Martyrius</i> returned to <i>Constantinople</i>,
whence arrived at <i>Rome</i>, soon after their Departure from
that City, <i>Theoctecnus</i>, a Presbyter of the Church of <i>Constantinople</i>,
and one of <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Friends, with Letters from Twenty-five Bishops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>informing <i>Innocent</i>, that <i>Chrysostom</i> had been driven a Second
time from his See; that he had been conducted by a Band of Soldiers
to <i>Cucusus</i>, and confined to that Place; and that the great
Church had been consumed by Fire, the very Day he was carried out
of <i>Constantinople</i>. <i>Innocent</i> was greatly affected with this Account,
and shed many Tears in reading it. But as these Troubles and Disorders
were fomented by some great Men at the Court either of
<i>Arcadius</i> or <i>Honorius</i>, and a Misunderstanding was then subsisting
between the Two Brothers, or their Ministers, he concluded, that his
Endeavours towards the restoring of Peace and Unity would prove
unsuccessful, and might even blow the Fire, which already burnt
with so much Violence, into a greater Flame. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Who sends Letters<br/>of Communion to them.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  On these Considerations
he wisely forbore making any Application for the present to
<i>Honorius</i>, and only sent Letters of Communion to <i>Chrysostom</i>, and
the Bishops, who had espoused his Cause<a id='r1418' /><a href='#f1418' class='c015'><sup>[1418]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Letters from</i> Acacius<br/><i>to</i> Innocent.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  These Letters were delivered
to <i>Theoctecnus</i>, who was scarce gone, when one <i>Paternus</i>,
who styled himself a Presbyter of the Church of <i>Constantinople</i>, arrived
at <i>Rome</i>, with Letters from <i>Acacius</i>, who had been intruded
into the See of <i>Constantinople</i>, and from some other Bishops of his
Party, charging <i>Chrysostom</i> with setting Fire to the <i>Basilic</i> or Great
Church. So barefaced a Calumny provoked <i>Innocent</i> to such a Degree,
that he would neither hear <i>Paternus</i>, nor return an Answer to
the Letters he had brought.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chrysostom<i>’s Friends<br/>cruelly persecuted</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the mean time a most cruel Persecution was railed at <i>Constantinople</i>,
against <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Friends, refusing to communicate with
<i>Acacius</i>, <i>Theophilus</i>, and <i>Porphyrius</i>, who had intruded himself into
the vacant See of <i>Antioch</i>, and, in Defiance of the Canons,
maintained, by Force of Arms, the Dignity he had usurped. This Persecution
was carried on under a Christian Emperor, with as much
Cruelty as any had ever been under the most inveterate Enemies of
the Christian Name. The Pretence they made use of was to discover
the Authors of the late Fire; and as the Imperial Officers chiefly
suspected, or pretended to suspect, <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Friends, <i>Optatus</i>, who
was then Prefect or Governor of <i>Constantinople</i>, and a Pagan, laid
hold of that Opportunity to vent upon them the implacable Hatred
he bore to the Religion they professed. Many therefore, without
Distinction of Sex or Condition, were, by his Orders, dragged to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>public Gaols, and confined there to Dungeons; others tormented with
such Barbarity as to expire on the Rack; and great Numbers, after
having undergone repeated Tortures, stript of all their Effects, and
banished to the most remote and desolate Places of the Empire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Two Edicts enacted<br/>against them.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>At the same time the Emperor <i>Arcadius</i>, strangely prepossessed
against <i>Chrysostom</i>, and those of his Communion, caused Two Edicts
to be published; the one directed to the Governors of the Provinces,
whom he strictly injoined not to suffer, in their respective Jurisdictions,
any private Assemblies or Meetings of Persons, who, despising the
Churches, worshiped elsewhere, lest they should seem to communicate
with the <i>most Reverend Prelates of the holy Law</i>, <i>Arsacius</i>, <i>Theophilus</i>,
and <i>Porphyrius</i>. The other commanded such Bishops as refused
to communicate with them, to be driven from their Sees, and
their Effects to be seized. The Persecution, which still raged, though
it was soon after stopt at the Remonstrances of <i>Studius</i> the <i>Præfectus
Prætorio</i>, and the Severity, with which the Two Imperial Edicts
were put in Execution, drove great Numbers, both of the Clergy and
Laity, from <i>Constantinople</i>, and the Provinces subject to <i>Arcadius</i>.
Among the former were <i>Cyriacus</i> Bishop of <i>Synnada</i>, <i>Eulysius</i> of <i>Apamea</i>
in <i>Bithynia</i>, <i>Palladius</i> of <i>Helenopolis</i>, <i>Germanus</i> a Presbyter,
and <i>Cassianus</i> a Deacon, who afterwards embraced the Monastic Life,
and became famous for his Ascetic Writings. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Several Bishops, and<br/>the whole Clergy of</i><br/>Constantinople, <i>write<br/>to</i> Innocent.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Eulysius</i> brought Letters
to <i>Innocent</i> from Fifteen Bishops of <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Communion, acquainting
him with the deplorable State of the <i>Constantinopolitan</i>
Church, and one from <i>Anysius</i> of <i>Thessalonica</i>, declaring, that in
the present unhappy Divisions he had resolved to conform intirely
to the Sentiments of the <i>Roman</i> Church. <i>Germanus</i> and <i>Cassianus</i>
likewise delivered Letters to <i>Innocent</i>, written in the Name of the
whole Clergy of <i>Constantinople</i>, and giving him an Account of the
Persecution that still raged, and of the cruel Treatment their Bishop
had met with<a id='r1419' /><a href='#f1419' class='c015'><sup>[1419]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Answer to the<br/>Clergy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Innocent</i>, in his Answer to this Letter, expresses, in
the most pathetic Terms, his Concern for the unhappy State of that
Church, and their Sufferings; he encourages them to bear, with Patience,
their present Tribulation and Afflictions, nay, and with Joy, since it is for
the sake of Justice they suffer, and are thus persecuted; he complains of
the undue Deposition of his Collegue, and Installation of another in
his Life-time, which he shows to be against the Canons of the Council
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>of <i>Nice</i>, the only Canons admitted and obeyed by the <i>Roman</i> Church:
he concludes with informing them, that as he had always thought it
necessary, that an Oecumenical Council should assemble, he had long
considered, and was still considering, by what Means it might be
assembled, <i>since a Council, and nothing else, could appease so violent
a Storm</i>, and restore to the Church the so much wished for Tranquillity<a id='r1420' /><a href='#f1420' class='c015'><sup>[1420]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two Presbyters in the mean time came to <i>Rome</i> from the East, <i>Domitianus</i>
of <i>Constantinople</i>, and <i>Vallagus</i> of <i>Nisibis</i> in <i>Mesopotamia</i>, and
brought with them the original Acts, which they had purchased with
a large Sum of the Imperial Officers, containing an authentic Detail
of the Cruelties which some Women of Quality had been made to endure
for not communicating with <i>Arsacius</i>, and the Bishops of his
Faction. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Innocent <i>applies to</i><br/>Honorius;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With these the good Bishop was so deeply affected, that he
could no longer forbear applying to <i>Honorius</i>, who, at his Request,
writ immediately to <i>Arcadius</i> a very pressing and friendly Letter in
favour of <i>Chrysostom</i>, and those of his Communion. At the same time
he issued an Order for convening a Council of the Western Bishops,
who, meeting soon after at <i>Rome</i>, drew up an Address, which they
sent to <i>Ravenna</i>, where the Emperor then was, earnestly intreating
him to interpose anew his good Offices with his Brother <i>Arcadius</i>,
that an Oecumenical Council might be allowed to assemble at <i>Thessalonica</i>,
in order to compose the present Differences, which had already
produced a Misunderstanding between the Eastern and Western
Churches, and might in the End bring on an intire Separation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who writes to</i> Arcad-<br/>ius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Honorius</i>,
in Compliance with their Request, writ a Third Letter to
<i>Arcadius</i> (for he had, it seems, written already a Second), and at the
same time one to <i>Innocent</i>, desiring him to appoint Five Bishops, Two
Presbyters of the <i>Roman</i> Church, and One Deacon, to carry his Letter
into the East, thinking that such a Legation would add no small
Weight to his Mediation. The Letter to <i>Arcadius</i> was in the following
Terms:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Letter.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>“This is the Third time I write to your Meekness (<i>ad Mansuetudinem
tuam</i>) intreating you to correct and rectify the iniquitous
Proceedings that have been carried on against <i>John</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>.
But nothing, I find, has been hitherto done in his Behalf.
Having therefore much at Heart the Peace of the Church,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>which will be attended with that of our Empire, I write to you anew
by these holy Bishops and Presbyters, earnestly desiring you to
command the Eastern Bishops to assemble at <i>Thessalonica</i>. The
Western Bishops have sent Five of their Body, Two Presbyters of
the <i>Roman</i> Church, and One Deacon, all Men of the strictest Equity,
and quite free from the Byass of Favour and Hatred. These I beg
you would receive with that Regard which is due to their Rank
and Merit: If they find <i>John</i> to have been justly deposed, they may
separate me from his Communion; and you from the Communion
of the Orientals, if it appears that he has been unjustly deposed.
The Western Bishops have very plainly expressed their Sentiments,
in the many Letters they have written to me on the Subject of the
present Dispute. Of these I send you Two, the one from the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>, the other from the Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>; and with
them the rest agree. One thing I must above all beg of your Meekness;
that you oblige <i>Theophilus</i> of <i>Alexandria</i> to assist at the
Council, how averse soever he may be to it; for he is said to be
the first and chief Author of the present Calamities. Thus the Synod,
meeting with no Delays or Obstructions, will restore Peace
and Tranquillity in our Days<a id='r1421' /><a href='#f1421' class='c015'><sup>[1421]</sup></a>.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Pope’s Legates<br/>not allowed to touch<br/>at</i> Thessalonica.</div>

<p class='c001'>With these Letters the Legates set out from <i>Rome</i>, attended by the
above-mentioned Prelates <i>Demetrius</i>, <i>Cyriacus</i>, <i>Eulysius</i>, and <i>Palladius</i>;
and, sailing for <i>Greece</i>, put in at <i>Athens</i>, with a Design to
pursue their Voyage to <i>Thessalonica</i>, having Letters from <i>Innocent</i> to
<i>Anysius</i> Bishop of that City. But at <i>Athens</i> they were, to their great
Surprize, stopt and detained by a Military Tribune, who let them
know, that they must not touch at <i>Thessalonica</i>; and at the same time
appointed a Centurion as a Guard over them, strictly injoining him
not to suffer them, under any Pretence whatsoever, to approach that
City. Soon after the Tribune parted them, and, putting them on
board Two Vessels, ordered the Mariners to convey them strait to <i>Constantinople</i>.
<i>Anysius</i> communicated with <i>Chrysostom</i>, as I have observed
above; and it was, without all doubt, on this Consideration
that the Legates were not allowed to set foot in his Diocese. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The hard Usage they<br/>met with on their<br/>Journey</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They
arrived at <i>Constantinople</i> the Third Day after they had left <i>Athens</i>,
but starved with Hunger; for the Tribune had neither supplied them
with Provisions when they embarked, nor allowed them Time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>supply themselves; so that they had tasted no Kind of Victuals during
the Three Days they were at Sea. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and at</i> Constant-<br/>inople.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> On their Arrival at <i>Constantinople</i>,
they were not suffered to come ashore there, but ordered to a Castle
on the <i>Thracian</i> Coast called <i>Athyra</i>, where they were all closely confined,
the Legates in one common Room, and the other Bishops in so
many separate Cells. As the People of <i>Constantinople</i> were most zealously
attached to <i>Chrysostom</i>, the Emperor apprehended, and with a
great deal of Reason, that their entering the City, and conversing
publicly there, might be attended with uncommon Disturbances and
Commotions; and therefore thought it adviseable to keep them at a
Distance, and under Confinement. They had not been long thus confined,
when they were ordered, they knew not by whom, to deliver
the Letters they had brought. But neither by this Person, whoever
he was, nor by several others, who were successively sent on the same
Errand, could they be prevailed upon to part with them, alleging,
that Letters from an Emperor ought to be delivered to none but an
Emperor.</p>

<p class='c001'>As they continued firm and unshaken in this Resolution, one <i>Valerian</i>,
a Military Tribune, was at last called in, and ordered to employ
the Rhetoric peculiar to his Profession, since no other could prevail.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Letters taken<br/>from them by Force.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Valerian</i> accordingly, after a short Preamble, proceeded to
Violence; and, seizing them, took the Letters by Force, having in
the Struggle wounded one of the Bishops in the Hand. The next
Day they were visited by a Person, who, without acquainting them
who he was, or by whom sent, offered them a very considerable Sum,
on condition they would communicate with <i>Atticus</i>, who, upon the
Death of <i>Arsacius</i>, had, by the Bishops of his Faction, been intruded
in his room. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They are put on board<br/>a leaky Vessel</i>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Upon their rejecting, as they did, with the utmost Indignation,
this Offer, <i>Valerian</i>, who was present, conducted them
under a strong Guard to the Sea-side, and there put them on board
an old leaky Vessel, having first, with a large Bribe, prevailed upon
the Commander, as they were informed, to engage his Word, that
they should not outlive that Voyage. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>but arrive safe in</i><br/>Italy.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They outlived it however, and,
having reached <i>Lampsacus</i>, they embarked on board another Vessel,
which landed them safe at <i>Otranto</i>. As for the Eastern Bishops who
had attended them from <i>Rome</i>, viz. <i>Cyriacus</i>, <i>Eulysius</i>, <i>Palladius</i>,
and <i>Demetrius</i>, after having been some time kept under close Confinement
at <i>Athyra</i>, they were banished to the most remote and abandoned
Places of the Empire. The other Bishops, who refused to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>communicate with <i>Atticus</i>, <i>Theophilus</i>, and <i>Porphyrius</i>, fared no
better, being in like manner either driven into Banishment, or obliged
to abscond, and, under the Disguise of Mechanics, earn their Livelihood
by the meanest Professions. Many perished in the Places of their
Exile for want of Necessaries; and others were so cruelly harassed,
nay, and barbarously beaten, by the merciless Soldiery, appointed to
conduct them, that they died on the Road<a id='r1422' /><a href='#f1422' class='c015'><sup>[1422]</sup></a>. Such were the wretched
Effects of that unchristian Principle of Persecution being lawful to
punish Error in religious Disputes, which all Sects of Christians then
held, and all suffered by in their Turns, as the different Parties
among them got the Civil Magistrate and Force on their Side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Honorius <i>resolves to<br/>revenge the Affront<br/>offered to his Embas-<br/>sadors, but is diverted<br/>from it</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Honorius</i>, being informed of the base Treatment the Legates had
met with, though vested with the sacred Character of Embassadors,
was so provoked at such a notorious Violation of the Right of Nations,
that he resolved to make War on his Brother, and revenge it by Force
of Arms. But from this Resolution he was diverted by a threatened
Invasion of the <i>Barbarians</i>, and the seasonable Discovery of the famous
<i>Stilicho</i>’s Treachery, which obliged him to keep all his Troops
in <i>Italy</i>, or the adjoining Provinces. As for <i>Innocent</i>, finding the
Mediation of <i>Honorius</i>, which he had procured, prove unsuccessful, and
no other Means left of affording the least Relief to <i>Chrysostom</i> and the
other persecuted Bishops, he resolved to make known to the World
his Abhorrence of the Evils, which it was not in his Power to redress;
and accordingly separated himself from the Communion of <i>Atticus</i>,
<i>Theophilus</i>, and <i>Porphyrius</i>, as the chief Authors of the present Calamities<a id='r1423' /><a href='#f1423' class='c015'><sup>[1423]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arcadius <i>and</i> Eudoxia<br/><i>not excommunicated<br/>by</i> Innocent.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Baronius</i>, thinking it inconsistent with the Dignity of his High
Pontiff thus tamely to bear with the insulting Conduct of <i>Arcadius</i>,
would fain persuade us, that, after he had tried in vain all other Methods
of bringing the Emperor, and the Empress <i>Eudoxia</i>, to a Sense
of their Duty, he at last thought himself obliged to thunder against
both the tremendous Sentence of Excommunication, cutting them off
as rotten Members from the Body of the Faithful committed to his
Care and Direction. To prove this, he produces several Letters from
<i>Innocent</i> to <i>Arcadius</i>, and from <i>Arcadius</i> to <i>Innocent</i>, transcribed
partly from <i>Gennadius</i>, <i>Glycas</i>, and <i>Nicephorus</i>, and partly from the
<i>Vatican</i> Manuscripts<a id='r1424' /><a href='#f1424' class='c015'><sup>[1424]</sup></a>. To enter into a critical Examination of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Pieces, would be wasting Time, and tiring the Reader to no Purpose.
I shall therefore content myself with Three Observations, each of them
sufficient, in my Opinion, to make the World reject them all as mere
Forgeries. In the first place, the Silence of the Historians, who writ
at that Time, touching so remarkable and unprecedented an Event as
the Excommunication of an Emperor and an Empress, is an unanswerable
Confutation of every Proof that can be alleged to support the
Authenticity of the pretended Letters. For who can imagine, that
the Writers, who flourished then, and have transmitted to us most
minute Accounts of far less important Transactions both Civil and
Ecclesiastical, would have passed this over in Silence? In the Second
place, <i>Eudoxia</i> is supposed, in all those Letters, to have outlived
<i>Chrysostom</i>; whereas it is certain, that she died in 404, four Years before
him. Lastly, In the above-mentioned Letter, <i>Arcadius</i> is all
along supposed to have repented, and changed his Conduct towards
<i>Chrysostom</i>, to have persecuted his Enemies as he had formerly done
his Friends, and to have chiefly vented his Resentment on the first
Author of all the Disturbances, the Empress, who thereupon, out of
Grief, Rage, and Despair, fell into a dangerous Malady<a id='r1425' /><a href='#f1425' class='c015'><sup>[1425]</sup></a>. But of all
this not the least Hint is to be met with in <i>Palladius</i>, who writ in
the last Days of the Life and Reign of <i>Arcadius</i>; nay, that Historian
speaks of the Friends of <i>Chrysostom</i> as Men still under the Emperor’s
Displeasure, and feeling the dreadful Effects of it in the inhospitable
Places, to which they had been formerly confined.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chrysostom <i>did not<br/>appeal to the See of</i><br/>Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>From the Conduct of <i>Chrysostom</i> on this Occasion, the <i>Roman-Catholic</i>
Divines have taken a great deal of Pains to prove, that the
Custom of appealing to the See of <i>Rome</i> obtained in his Time; that
he actually appealed to that See; and consequently, that the Prerogative
of receiving Appeals from all Parts, and finally deciding all Controversies,
claimed by the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, was then acknowleged
even in the East. Nothing surely but the utmost Distress for want of
other Instances to prove their Assertion, could have tempted them to
make use of this; since, from the Conduct of <i>Chrysostom</i> on this very
Occasion, nay, and from that of <i>Innocent</i> too, if set in their true
Light, it may be undeniably made out, that this pretended Prerogative
was utterly unknown to both. The Fact stand thus, and thus it
is related by the Historians, who have transmitted it to us: <i>Chrysostom</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>is unjustly accused; the Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i> takes upon him to inquire
into his Conduct; assembles a Council, consisting chiefly of
<i>Egyptian</i> Bishops, and summons <i>Chrysostom</i> to appear before them:
<i>Chrysostom</i> pays no Regard to the Summons, protests against it, and
will not allow the Bishops assembled to have any Power or Authority
over him, <i>since it had been ordained by the Canons of the Church,
that the Affairs of the Provinces should be regulated by the Bishops
of the Provinces; and it was consequently very incongruous, that
the Bishops of</i> Thrace <i>should be judged by those of</i> Egypt<a id='r1426' /><a href='#f1426' class='c015'><sup>[1426]</sup></a>. No Regard
is had to his Protest, none to the Canons upon which it was
grounded: he is summoned anew; and, not appearing within the limited
Time, is judged, condemned, and deposed. From this Sentence
he appeals to a lawful Council; but, being, notwithstanding
his Appeal, driven from his See, he recurs at last to the Western Bishops,
namely, to <i>Innocent</i> of <i>Rome</i>, <i>Venerius</i> of <i>Milan</i>, and <i>Chromatius</i>
of <i>Aquileia</i>, intreating them not to abandon him in his Distress,
nor exclude him from their Communion<a id='r1427' /><a href='#f1427' class='c015'><sup>[1427]</sup></a>, but to procure by
all means the assembling of a General Council, in order to restore the
Church to her former Tranquillity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chrysostom <i>an utter<br/>Stranger to the Power<br/>of receiving Appeals<br/>in the Bishops of</i><br/>Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>Such was the Conduct of <i>Chrysostom</i>: and, from this Conduct,
does it not manifestly appear, that <i>Chrysostom</i> was an utter Stranger
to the pretended Power in the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> of receiving Appeals
from all other Tribunals, and finally determining all Controversies?
Who can think, that, had he been acquainted with such a Prerogative,
he would, when so unjustly oppressed, have appealed to a Council,
which, he was well apprised, would meet with great Obstructions,
when he had, ready at hand, a more certain and easy Method of
finding Relief? Had he been satisfied, that <i>Innocent</i> had such a Privilege,
is it likely he would have written to him on so urgent an Occasion,
without taking the least Notice of it; that he would have
contented himself with only intreating him to procure the assembling
of a General Council? Should a Bishop now, apprehending himself
injured by a National or Provincial Synod, appeal, not to the Pope,
but, as <i>Chrysostom</i> did, to a General Council, he would, by such
an Appeal, draw upon himself the Indignation of the <i>Roman</i> See:
for it would be thence concluded, and no Conclusion can be more
natural, that he did not acknowlege the Power of receiving <i>Appeals</i>
claimed by that See.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chrysostom <i>never<br/>acknowleged such a<br/>Power</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>But <i>Chrysostom</i>, say they, did acknowledge such a Power; for, in
his Letter to <i>Innocent</i>, he intreats him <i>to declare such wicked Proceedings
void and null, and to pronounce all, who had any Share in
them, punishable, according to the Ecclesiastical Laws</i>. But <i>Chrysostom</i>
addresses himself here, not to <i>Innocent</i> alone, as I have already
observed, but to him, in Conjunction with <i>Venerius</i> of <i>Milan</i>, and
<i>Chromatius</i> of <i>Aquileia</i><a id='r1428' /><a href='#f1428' class='c015'><sup>[1428]</sup></a>; nay, he addresses himself, throughout the
whole Letter, to more Persons than one; and yet <i>Baronius</i> has the
Assurance to style the Letter an <i>Appeal</i> to <i>Innocent</i><a id='r1429' /><a href='#f1429' class='c015'><sup>[1429]</sup></a>. And why to
him, and not to the other Two, since he writ nothing to him but
what he writ to them? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Disingenuity of</i><br/>Bellarmine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Bellarmine</i>, finding some Expressions in the

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent<i>’s Letter to</i><br/>Exuperius <i>Bishop of</i><br/>Toulouse.</div>

<p class='c001'>About this time, that is, in the Year 405. <i>Innocent</i>, being consulted
by <i>Exuperius</i><a id='rN50' /><a href='#fN50' class='c015'><sup>[N50]</sup></a> Bishop of <i>Toulouse</i>, concerning some Points of
Discipline, answered him by a Decretal, containing the following
Decisions: 1. That the Priests and Deacons, who were daily employed
in sacrificing or baptizing, were not to be allowed the Use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>of Matrimony; that those, who were ignorant of the Decretal issued
by <i>Syricius</i>, might be forgiven, upon their promising thenceforth to
live continent; but, as to the rest, they should, as unworthy of Indulgence,
be deposed. The Second Article relates to those, who,
after Baptism, had led a wicked or sinful Life, and at the Point of
Death desired the Communion. <i>Innocent</i> declares, that to such,
according to the antient Discipline of the Church, which was more
severe, Repentance was granted, and not the Communion; but, according
to the present Practice, both were granted. By Repentance
is here meant, according to the most probable Opinion, a Reconciliation
with the Church; and, by the Communion, the Eucharist,
which the Thirteenth Canon of the Council of <i>Nice</i> commands to be
given to all dying Persons who desire it. Some doubted whether it
was lawful for a Christian to discharge the Office of a Judge, in criminal
Cases. <i>Innocent</i> therefore declares, in the Third Article, that
no Penance ought to be imposed upon those who had condemned
Criminals to the Rack, or even to Death, the Civil Power having
been established by God for the Punishment of Criminals. As Women
were, it seems, more frequently punished for Adultery than Men,
some imagined that Crime not to be alike punishable in both. This
Notion <i>Innocent</i> confutes in the Fourth Article; adding, that Women
were more frequently punished, merely because the Husbands
were more forward in accusing their Wives, than Wives were in accusing
their Husbands. The Fifth Article is a Confirmation of the
Third; for it only absolves from all Sins such as are obliged, by
their Office, to prosecute or condemn Criminals. The Sixth Article
excludes from the Communion of the Church all Men, who,
after they have been parted from their Wives, marry other Women;
and all Women, who, after they have been parted from their Husbands,
marry other Men<a id='rN51' /><a href='#fN51' class='c015'><sup>[N51]</sup></a>. The same Punishment is, by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Article, inflicted on those who marry them, but not on their Parents
or Relations, provided they have been no-way accessory to that unlawful
Contract. The last Article contains a Catalogue of the Canonical
Books of Scripture, the same as are still acknowleged by the
Church of <i>Rome</i> as Canonical. In the same Article, some Books
are pointed out, that ought to be absolutely condemned and rejected<a id='r1431' /><a href='#f1431' class='c015'><sup>[1431]</sup></a><a id='rN52' /><a href='#fN52' class='c015'><sup>[N52]</sup></a>.
These Directions, or Instructions, <i>Innocent</i> pretends to
have drawn partly from Scripture, and partly from Tradition; and
thanks <i>Exuperius</i>, because he had, by applying to him for a Solution
to his Difficulties, engaged him to examine them with Attention,
and thereby given him an Opportunity of learning what he had not
known before. It is surprising he should have mentioned the Scripture,
since the very first Article, debarring for ever married Men
from the Use of Matrimony, is an open Contradiction to the Directions
given by St. <i>Paul</i> to all married Persons, without Restraint
or Distinction; <i>Defraud you not one the other, except it be with</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span><i>Consent for a time</i>, &amp;c. <i>and come together again, that Satan tempt
you not for your Incontinency</i><a id='r1432' /><a href='#f1432' class='c015'><sup>[1432]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fN50'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN50'>N50</a>. <i>Exuperius</i> was, as we gather from
<i>Ausonius</i>, a Native of <i>Bourdeaux</i>, one of
the greatest Orators of his Time, and had
governed <i>Spain</i> in Quality of Prefect.  He
afterwards withdrew from the World; embraced
the Ecclesiastical State in the Place
of his Nativity<a id='rN50.1' /><a href='#fN50.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>; and was, for his eminent
Virtues, raised to the See of <i>Toulouse</i>.
He was chiefly commendable for his Charity
to the Poor; though he bestowed
the greater Part of it on Objects, perhaps,

for, by the Monk <i>Sisennius</i>, he

Nations; who, accordingly, broke into

itself. It was, however, this Kindness
of <i>Exuperius</i> to the Monks, that
chiefly recommended him to <i>Jerom</i><a id='rN50.3' /><a href='#fN50.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, who

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN51'>N51</a>. The matrimonial Bond is held, by
the Church of <i>Rome</i>, indissoluble, and a
Separation only allowed as to Bed and
Board, even in Cases of Adultery; whence
it follows, that so long as they both live,
neither can marry, without being guilty of
Adultery. There are, however, some <i>annulling
Impediments</i>, as the Canonists style
them, that is, Circumstances rendering
the Marriage-contract null; and if any of
these intervene, and is made to appear,
the Parties are then declared not to have
been married; and, consequently, free to
marry whom they please. Till <i>Innocent</i>’s
Time, Men, who had been parted from
their Wives convicted of Adultery, were
allowed to marry again. This <i>Epiphanius</i>
tells us in express Terms; adding, that,
agreeably to Scripture (no doubt to <i>Matt.</i> v.
32.), it could be no Crime to marry again;
that those who married again were not excluded,
on that score, from Life everlasting;
and consequently ought not to be excluded
from the Communion of the Church<a id='rN51.1' /><a href='#fN51.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The
Scope and Design of <i>Epiphanius</i>, throughout
his Work, was to acquaint us with the several
Heresies that sprung up in the Church, and to
explain, in Opposition to them, the Catholic
Doctrines. It must therefore have been
deemed a Heresy in his Time, that is, towards
the latter End of the Fourth Century,
to think the matrimonial Bond indissoluble,
even in Cases of Adultery, or
to hold it unlawful for a Man to marry
again, who had put away his Wife <i>for the
Cause of Fornication</i>. But the Heresy became
afterwards a Catholic Truth, and the
Catholic Truth a Heresy. This Change,
however, was not so much owing to <i>Innocent</i>’s
Decretal, as to the Two Books,
which St. <i>Austin</i> writ about the Year
419. to prove, that it is unlawful for a
Husband, who has put away his Wife, even
for Adultery, or for a Wife who has been
thus put away, to marry again, while both
are living. He founds his Opinion on
that of St. <i>Paul</i>, <i>The Wife is bound by the
Law, as long as her Husband liveth</i><a id='rN51.2' /><a href='#fN51.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
But, instead of understanding that Passage
with the Exception made by our Saviour
himself, <i>Whosoever shall put away his Wife,
saving for the Cause of Fornication</i>, &amp;c. he
endeavours, by many logical Distinctions,
and unnatural Interpretations, to remove
that Exception, though expressed by the
Evangelist in the plainest Terms. He was
therein, no doubt, misled, by the groundless,
but then reigning, Notion, of an extraordinary
Merit annexed to Celibacy;
and therefore ends his Word with exhorting
the Husbands, who have put away
their Wives, to observe Continency, in
Imitation of the Ecclesiastics, who observe
it (says he) with the greatest Exactness,
though it was not by their own Choice
that some of them went into Orders. It
may be questioned, whether, even then,
the Continence of the unmarried Clergy
was such as he represents it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> had, ever since the time of <i>Damasus</i>,
taken upon them to appoint the Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i> their Vicar
for <i>East-Illyricum</i>, <i>Innocent</i> no sooner heard, that <i>Rufus</i> had been
promoted to that See, vacant by the Death of <i>Anysius</i>, than he let
all the Bishops in those Parts know, by a Circular Letter, probably
directed to <i>Rufus</i> himself, that he conferred on him the same Dignity
which his Predecessors had conferred on the other Bishops of <i>Thessalonica</i>.
He writ, at the same time, a private Letter to <i>Rufus</i>, containing
some Instructions relating to the Exercise of his Vicarious
Power, and, with them, the Names of the Provinces which he was
to govern, as his Vicar and First Primate; but without intrenching,
adds <i>Innocent</i>, upon the Rights and Privileges of the Primate or
Metropolitan of each Province. In this Letter he takes great Care,
that <i>Rufus</i> should not forget he is indebted for such a Power to the
See of <i>Rome</i>; for that he frequently repeats, as if he entertained
some Jealousy of <i>Rufus</i>, or apprehended that he might claim such a
Power, as Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i>, that City being, according to the
Civil Division of the Empire, on which the Ecclesiastical was ingrafted,
the Metropolis of <i>East-Illyricum</i><a id='r1433' /><a href='#f1433' class='c015'><sup>[1433]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rome <i>reduced to<br/>great Streights by</i><br/>Alaric.</div>

<p class='c001'>The same Year 407. the Emperor <i>Honorius</i> visited the City of
<i>Rome</i>, and continued there till the Month of <i>May</i> of the Year 408.
On the 23d of the following <i>August</i>, <i>Stilicho</i> was killed; and <i>Alaric</i>
the <i>Goth</i>, entering <i>Italy</i> soon after his Death, appeared before <i>Rome</i>,
and laid close Siege to that City in the latter End of the same Year.
As no Provisions could be conveyed into the Place, all the Avenues
being shut up, and well guarded, a Famine soon ensued, and upon
the Famine a Plague, which daily swept off great Numbers of the
Inhabitants. In this Extremity, such of the Senators as still adhered
to the Pagan Superstitions, promising themselves Relief from the Gods
of their Ancestors, resolved to implore their Protection, by solemn
Sacrifices offered up to them in the Capitol, and other public Places
of the City. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Pagan <i>Super-<br/>stitions connived at by</i><br/>Innocent.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This Resolution, says <i>Zosimus</i><a id='r1434' /><a href='#f1434' class='c015'><sup>[1434]</sup></a>, they imparted to <i>Innocent</i>,
then Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, who, sacrificing his private Opinion
to the public Welfare, agreed to it, on Condition that the Ceremony
should be privately performed. Of these Sacrifices <i>Sozomen</i> too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>takes particular Notice<a id='r1435' /><a href='#f1435' class='c015'><sup>[1435]</sup></a>; but makes no Mention of <i>Innocent</i>; which
has induced some to suspect the Veracity of <i>Zosimus</i>, who was, as is
well known, a sworn Enemy to the Christian Religion. But that
those Sacrifices were performed, is affirmed both by him and <i>Sozomen</i>;
and it is not at all probable, that <i>Pompeianus</i>, who was then Governor
of <i>Rome</i>, and a Christian, would have suffered them, without
the Consent and Approbation of <i>Innocent</i>. However that be, I see
not why <i>Baronius</i> should be so provoked against <i>Zosimus</i>, for making
<i>Innocent</i> thus connive at the superstitious Worship of the Gentiles,
since his Successors have always allowed, and do still allow, even in
<i>Rome</i> itself, the free Exercise of the <i>Jewish</i> Worship.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent <i>leaves</i><br/>Rome, <i>and repairs to<br/>the Emperor at</i> Rav-<br/>enna.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Rome</i> being reduced to the last Extremity, Deputies were, in the
End, sent out to treat with <i>Alaric</i>, who, hearkening to their Proposals,
raised the Siege, upon their paying to him Five thousand
Pounds Weight of Gold, Thirty thousand of Silver, Four thousand
Silk Garments, Three thousand Skins of Purple Dye, and as many
Pounds of Pepper. At the same time the <i>Romans</i> engaged to mediate
a Peace between him and <i>Honorius</i>: but the Emperor refusing
to comply with the Terms that were proposed, though no-ways unreasonable,
the <i>Roman</i> Senate sent Two solemn Deputations to <i>Ravenna</i>,
where <i>Honorius</i> then resided, to lay before him the Danger
to which he exposed the Empire, and persuade him to accept the
Conditions offered him both by them and by <i>Alaric</i>. As the First
Deputation proved unsuccessful, <i>Innocent</i>, thinking his Presence might
give some Weight to the Negotiations, left <i>Rome</i>, and, together with
the Deputies, repaired to <i>Ravenna</i>. Thus he escaped the Mortification
of seeing the City of <i>Rome</i> taken and plundered by the Barbarians<a id='r1436' /><a href='#f1436' class='c015'><sup>[1436]</sup></a>.
For, <i>Honorius</i> still rejecting the Terms of Peace, <i>Alaric</i>
returned with his Army before <i>Rome</i>; and, having made himself Master
of it on the 24th of <i>August</i> of the Year 410. treated the great Metropolis

Churches, those Ecclesiastics, who, having adhered to <i>Bonosus</i> after
his Condemnation, were willing to return, provided they had been
ordained by him before his Condemnation. One of these, by Name
<i>Rusticus</i>, to remove all Doubt concerning the Validity of his Ordination,
had caused himself to be reordained by a Catholic Bishop;

the Day on which <i>Easter</i> was to be kept in the Year 414. He acquaints

that Year on the 22d of the Month, and the 23d of the Moon on
the 29th of the Month; and consequently that, in his Opinion, <i>Easter</i>
ought to be kept on the 22d of <i>March</i>. However, he desires
<i>Aurelius</i> to discuss that Point in the Council of the <i>African</i> Bishops,
that was in a short time to be held at <i>Carthage</i>; and to let him know,
whether they approved of such a Regulation, or what they objected
against it, that he might solemnly notify by his Letters, according to

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Letter of the<br/>Bishops of</i> Macedon<br/><i>to</i> Innocent.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Year 414. <i>Vitalis</i>, Archdeacon probably of <i>Thessalonica</i>,
arrived at <i>Rome</i>, with Letters for <i>Innocent</i>, from the Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>,
touching certain Points of Discipline which, it seems, they
had referred to him, and he had decided before. In this Letter they
represent to him, in the first Place, that, according to the Custom
and Practice of their Churches, the marrying a Widow was no Bar or
Impediment to Orders, or even to the Episcopal Dignity; and that
to marry one Wife before, and a Second after, Baptism, was not, with
them, deemed Bigamy. Then passing to those, who had been ordained
by <i>Bonosus</i>, they declare it as their Opinion, that nothing
more could be required than the Blessing of a lawful Bishop to re-admit
them to the Functions of their Office. They conclude with begging
Leave to raise to the Episcopal Dignity one <i>Photinus</i>, who had
been condemned by the Predecessors of <i>Innocent</i>, and to depose a
Deacon, by Name <i>Eustatius</i><a id='r1441' /><a href='#f1441' class='c015'><sup>[1441]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>This Letter <i>Innocent</i> answered, almost in the Style and Language
of a modern Pope. He begins with expressing his Surprize at the
Affront they offered to the Apostolic See, by calling in Doubt what
he had already decided. He then answers, one by one, the Heads
of their Letter, with all the Authority of an unerring Judge, though
neither he, nor any of his Predecessors, had ever yet claimed, or
thought of claiming, such a Prerogative. He absolutely condemns
the Practice of admitting to Orders such as had married Widows, because
that was forbidden, says he, by <i>Moses</i> to the High Priest of the
<i>Jews</i>; which was tacitly declaring the <i>Levitical</i> Laws to be still, in
some Degree, binding with respect to the Christian Clergy. He adds,
that if any such had been ordained, it was the general Practice of all
the Churches, both in the East and West, to depose them<a id='rN53' /><a href='#fN53' class='c015'><sup>[N53]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Innocent <i>declares Or-<br/>ders conferred by Heretics<br/>to be null</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> As

<i>Innocent</i> declares them equally incapable of being ordained
as if they had married both<a id='rN54' /><a href='#fN54' class='c015'><sup>[N54]</sup></a>. As to the Ecclesiastics ordained by
<i>Bonosus</i>, <i>Innocent</i> not only excludes them from the Ministry, but
endeavours to prove in general, that Orders, when conferred by Heretics,
are null, borrowing, for that Purpose, of St. <i>Cyprian</i>, all the
Arguments which that Father had made use of to prove a no less erroneous
Opinion; <i>viz.</i> the Nullity of Baptism, when conferred by Heretics<a id='rN55' /><a href='#fN55' class='c015'><sup>[N55]</sup></a>.</p>

the Conduct of his Predecessors, who had condemned <i>Photinus</i>; but
nevertheless, since so many Prelates had made it appear by their joint
Testimonies, that the Holy See had been imposed upon by false and
groundless Reports, he agrees to his Promotion. As to the Deacon
<i>Eustatius</i>, he lets them know, that, whatever Reports may have been
spread to his Prejudice, he is well assured both of his Probity, and
the Purity of his Faith, and therefore cannot consent to his Deposition.

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Misunderstanding between the Eastern and Western Churches continues after the Death of</i> Chrysostom.</div>

<p class='c001'>We have observed above, that <i>Chrysostom</i> being driven from the
See of <i>Constantinople</i> into Exile, <i>Innocent</i>, and with him most of
the Western Bishops, had espoused his Cause with great Warmth;
but, finding that all their Endeavours in his Behalf proved unsuccessful,
they at last separated themselves from the Communion of
<i>Atticus</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>Porphyrius</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, and <i>Theophilus</i> of
<i>Alexandria</i>. In the Year 407. <i>Chrysostom</i> died at <i>Cumana</i> in <i>Pontus</i>;
but with him did not die the Animosities, which his Deposition had
occasioned between the Churches of the East and the West. <i>Atticus</i>
indeed thought nothing could now obstruct the wished-for Union;
and therefore, as soon as <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Death was known, he applied
to <i>Rome</i>, desiring the Communion of that Church. But he was
greatly surprised, when he understood, that <i>Innocent</i>, instead of readily
granting him his Request, insisted upon his first acknowleging
<i>Chrysostom</i> to have been, and to have died, lawful Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>by inrolling his Name in the Diptychs<a id='rN56' /><a href='#fN56' class='c015'><sup>[N56]</sup></a>, with the
Names of other Bishops of that City. This Demand seemed to <i>Atticus</i>
highly unreasonable; for it was obliging him to acknowlege
his own Election to have been null. He therefore peremptorily refused
to comply with it; but nevertheless continued soliciting, by
means of his Friends at <i>Rome</i>, a Reconciliation with that Church<a id='r1443' /><a href='#f1443' class='c015'><sup>[1443]</sup></a>.
But <i>Innocent</i> was inflexible; he was determined at all Events to carry
his Point, and therefore would hearken to no other Terms till that
was complied with. The Eastern Bishops followed the Example of
<i>Atticus</i>; the Western that of <i>Innocent</i>. And thus were the Separation,
and the Animosities attending it, continued Seven Years longer,
each Party bitterly inveighing, in the mean time, against the Authors

the deceased Prelate’s Name to be inserted in the Diptychs of his
Church, and the Two Bishops <i>Helpidius</i> and <i>Pappus</i> to be restored
to their Sees, from which they had been driven for refusing to renounce
his Communion, and to communicate with his Enemies. After
this <i>Alexander</i> sent a solemn Deputation to <i>Rome</i>, at the Head of
which was, it seems, the famous <i>Cassian</i>, to acquaint <i>Innocent</i> with
his Promotion, to inform him of what he had done, and thereupon
to renew the Union between the Two Churches. <i>Alexander</i>, who
entertained a sincere Desire of seeing Peace and Concord restored between
the East and the West, did not doubt but the Example of his
Church would be followed by many others, and a Way, by that
Means, be paved to a general Pacification. <i>Innocent</i> received the Deputation
with the greatest Marks of Joy, admitted <i>Alexander</i> to his
Communion, and, with the Consent and Approbation of Twenty-Four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>other Bishops, declared the Church of <i>Antioch</i> again united to
that of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Bishop of</i> Antioch <i>strives to reconcile the Churches of</i> Rome <i>and</i> Constantinople.</div>

<p class='c001'>Several other Bishops, moved partly by the Example, and partly
by the Letters and Exhortations of the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, yielded
to <i>Innocent</i>, and submitted to the Terms he required. But <i>Atticus</i>
still adhered to his former Resolution, and, to gain him, <i>Alexander</i>,
who spared no Pains to complete the Work he had begun, repaired
in Person to <i>Constantinople</i>. But he acted there with such Indiscretion
as rendered that haughty Prelate more averse, than he had ever yet
been, to an Accommodation on the Terms proposed by <i>Innocent</i>. For
all other Means he could think of, to compass his Design, proving
unsuccessful, he resolved in the End to apply to the Populace, who,
as he well knew, had been most zealously attached to <i>Chrysostom</i>
during his Life, and revered him as a Saint after his Death. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His imprudent<br/>Conduct.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Suffering
therefore his Zeal to get the better of his Prudence, and of every
Consideration Prudence could suggest, he began to harangue the Multitude,
and inflame them with seditious Speeches against <i>Atticus</i>, as
carrying, even beyond the Grave, his Hatred and Malice against their
holy Bishop. The Populace heard him with Attention, applauded his
Zeal, and, full of Rage against <i>Atticus</i>, demanded, in a tumultuous
manner, that the Name of so holy, so great and deserving a Prelate,
might be inrolled, without further Delay, in the Diptychs. But their
Clamours and Threats made no more Impression on the Mind of
<i>Atticus</i> than the Reasons of <i>Alexander</i>; he withstood both; and
the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, finding all his Attempts thus shamefully
baffled, returned to his See, with the Mortification of having only
widened the Breach, which he intended to close, between the Churches
of <i>Rome</i> and <i>Constantinople</i><a id='r1444' /><a href='#f1444' class='c015'><sup>[1444]</sup></a>. <i>Baronius</i> supposes <i>Alexander</i> to have
acted on this Occasion as <i>Innocent</i>’s Legate<a id='r1445' /><a href='#f1445' class='c015'><sup>[1445]</sup></a>. But I find nothing in
the Antients to countenance such a Supposition, besides his haughty
Behaviour, and his pursuing, by the most unwarrantable Methods,
what he had in View.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Name of</i> Chryso-<br/>stom <i>inrolled in the<br/>Diptychs by the Bish-<br/>op of</i> Constantinople.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Atticus</i>, however, allowed, in the End, <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Name to be
inserted in the Diptychs; but whether he did it by Choice or Compulsion,
is uncertain; for, in one of his Letters, he writes, that he
could no longer withstand the Threats and Violence of the enraged
Multitude<a id='r1446' /><a href='#f1446' class='c015'><sup>[1446]</sup></a>; and in another, that he had done it to comply with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>the Will of the Emperors, and to conform to the Sentiments of his
Brethren, both in the East and the West<a id='r1447' /><a href='#f1447' class='c015'><sup>[1447]</sup></a>. However that be, it is
certain, that he never changed his Sentiments with respect to <i>Chrysostom</i>,
as is manifest from his declaring, after he had placed his Name
in the Diptychs, that he thereby meant no more than to own, that
he had been once Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>; but that he still adhered
to the Judgment that was given against him. With this, however,
<i>Innocent</i> was satisfied; and so is <i>Baronius</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Two Churches<br/>re-united at last.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><i>Alexander</i> maintained ever after a close Correspondence with <i>Innocent</i>,
courting his Favour with the most servile Submissions, recurring
to him in every momentous Affair relating to his Church, and suffering
himself to be blindly guided by his Counsels. In one of his Letters
he consulted him, it seems, concerning the Prerogatives of his See,
and the Extent of his Jurisdiction; and nothing can be more subtle
than <i>Innocent</i>’s Answer. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Innocent<i>’s Letter  to</i><br/>Alexander <i>of</i> Ant-<br/>ioch.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For after a long Preamble on the Dignity of
the See of <i>Antioch</i>, he craftily insinuates all the Privileges and Prerogatives
annexed to it to be owing not to the Dignity of the City, but
to the Dignity of the See, as having been once the See of St. <i>Peter</i>.
He adds, that on this Consideration it had been distinguished with
an extensive Jurisdiction, and that it yielded to that of <i>Rome</i> itself only
because St. <i>Peter</i> had accomplished there what he had begun at <i>Antioch</i><a id='r1448' /><a href='#f1448' class='c015'><sup>[1448]</sup></a>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Prerogatives of the See of</i> Rome <i>owing to the City, and not to St.</i> Peter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> What <i>Innocent</i> proposed to himself by thus exalting the See
of <i>Antioch</i>, by deriving the Privileges, Prerogatives, and Jurisdiction,
of that See from St. <i>Peter</i>, is obvious. If they were owing not to
the City, but to St. <i>Peter</i>, as <i>Innocent</i> affirms, those enjoyed by the
See of <i>Rome</i> were, in like manner, owing to St. <i>Peter</i>, and not to
the City. This Notion, now first started by <i>Innocent</i>, was not suffered
to drop; but, being greedily embraced by his Successors, it was,
in Process of Time, improved by them into a general Plea for all
their exorbitant Claims. And thus <i>Innocent</i> may be justly said to have
pointed out the Ground on which the unwieldy Fabric of the Papal
Power was afterwards built. But if it be true, as <i>Innocent</i> pretends,
that the See of <i>Antioch</i> owed its Dignity to St. <i>Peter</i>, and not to the
City, how will he account for its being ranked under that of <i>Alexandria</i>,
which was neither founded, nor had ever been honoured, by
that Apostle? But not to waste Time in combating such a groundless
Notion, nothing is more certain, than that the Disposition and Division
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of the Church was founded upon, and intirely agreeable to, the Disposition
and Division of the Empire<a id='r1449' /><a href='#f1449' class='c015'><sup>[1449]</sup></a>; and consequently that as no
Regard was had to St. <i>Peter</i>, or any other Apostle, in the Civil, none
could be had in the Ecclesiastical, Polity. And hence it naturally
follows, that as <i>Rome</i> was the first City of the Empire, <i>Alexandria</i>
the Second, and <i>Antioch</i> the Third, the Sees should be ranked in the
same Order; and in the same Order they were ranked accordingly,
though the See of <i>Alexandria</i> was founded only by a Disciple of St.
<i>Peter</i>, and that of <i>Antioch</i> was supposed to have been founded by
St. <i>Peter</i> himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Division of the<br/>Church founded on the<br/>Division of the Empire.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This Division of the Church took place soon after the Division of
the Empire made by <i>Constantine the Great</i>, on which it was founded.
It was first introduced by Custom, but afterwards confirmed by several
Councils; and in none of them is there a Word of St. <i>Peter</i>.
As therefore the Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i> preceded in Rank the Bishop of
<i>Antioch</i>, for no other Reason but because the City of <i>Alexandria</i>
preceded in Dignity the City of <i>Antioch</i>, according to the secular
Constitutions of the Empire; so the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> preceded in Rank
all other Bishops, for no other Reason but because the City of <i>Rome</i>,
as the Seat of the Empire, preceded in Dignity all other Cities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent <i>encour-<br/>ages the Bishop<br/>of</i> Antioch <i>to<br/>invade the Rights<br/>of the Metropol-<br/>itans</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>But to return to <i>Innocent</i>: In the same Letter to <i>Alexander</i> he observes,
that the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> did not preside over a single Province,
but a whole Diocese; and therefore advises him not only to maintain
the Right he had of ordaining the Metropolitans, but not to suffer
other Bishops in the Provinces under his Jurisdiction, however distant,
to be ordained without his Consent and Approbation. He adds, that,
with respect to the Bishops of the less remote Provinces, he might reserve
to himself the Right of ordaining them<a id='r1450' /><a href='#f1450' class='c015'><sup>[1450]</sup></a>. This was encouraging
the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> to invade and usurp the undoubted Rights of
the Metropolitans, in open Defiance of the Fourth and Sixth Canons
of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, which were afterwards confirmed by almost
innumerable other Councils, all granting to the Metropolitans the
Power of ordaining the Bishops of their respective Provinces jointly
with the Bishops of the same Province, without ever once mentioning
the Patriarch or Head of the Diocese<a id='r1451' /><a href='#f1451' class='c015'><sup>[1451]</sup></a>. But of this Right the Bishops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>of <i>Rome</i> had deprived the Metropolitans under their Jurisdiction as
early at least as the Time of <i>Syricius</i>; for that Pope, in the Letter
which he writ to <i>Anysius</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i>, appointing him
his Vicar for <i>East-Illyricum</i>, charges him not to suffer any Bishops to
be ordained in those Provinces without his Consent and Approbation.
<i>Innocent</i> maintained what his Predecessors had usurped; and, to countenance
their Usurpation and his own, he encourages, by this Letter,
the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> to pursue the same Conduct with respect to the
Metropolitans of his Diocese. The Example of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>
was, in Process of Time, followed by those of <i>Constantinople</i>, who,
rivaling them in Pride and Ambition, not only usurped the Power of
ordaining all the Bishops of their Diocese, but, by the Interest they
had at Court, obtained an Imperial Rescript, confirming to them the
Power which they had usurped. But they were soon obliged to part
with it, though thus guaranteed, by the Fathers of the Council of
<i>Chalcedon</i> impowering, by their Twenty-eighth Canon, the Bishops of
<i>Constantinople</i> to ordain the Metropolitans in the Dioceses of <i>Pontus</i>,
<i>Asia</i>, and <i>Thrace</i>; but at the same time ascertaining to the Metropolitans
the Right of ordaining the Bishops of their respective Provinces.
But the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, ever determined to part with no
Power, however acquired, found means not only to elude the Decrees
of this and several other Councils, ascertaining the Rights of the
Metropolitans in the plainest Terms, but to improve, by daily Incroachments,
their usurped Jurisdiction, as I shall have frequent Occasion
to observe in the Sequel of this History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent<i>’s Letter<br/>occasions great<br/>Disputes between the<br/>Bishops of</i>Antioch<br/><i>and those of</i> Cyprus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i> complains, in the next Article of his Letter, of a Custom
that obtained in the Island of <i>Cyprus</i>. It was one of the chief Privileges
of the Patriarch, or Bishop, who presided over a whole Diocese,
to ordain the Metropolitans of the Provinces comprised under his
Diocese. But the Metropolitan of <i>Cyprus</i> was ordained by the Bishops
of that Island without the Consent, or even the Privity, of the Bishop
of <i>Antioch</i>, though <i>Cyprus</i> belonged to his Province, according to
the Civil Division of the Empire. This Custom <i>Innocent</i> condemns,
as repugnant to the Canons of the Council of <i>Nice</i>; adding, that it
was first introduced in the unhappy Times when <i>Arianism</i> prevailed all
over <i>Syria</i>, the Bishops of <i>Cyprus</i> refusing then to acknowlege those
of <i>Antioch</i>, who were infected with that Heresy. This Article proved
the Source of endless Disputes between the Bishops of <i>Antioch</i> and
those of <i>Cyprus</i>; the former pretending, that the Power of ordaining
the Metropolitan of <i>Cyprus</i> was lodged in them, and the latter opposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>with great Warmth such a Pretension. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Which are in the End<br/>decided in favour of<br/>the latter.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Controversy was at
length referred to the Council of <i>Ephesus</i>; and the Fathers of that
numerous Assembly, having heard and examined with great Attention
the Pleas of both Parties, condemned in the strongest Terms the Pretension
of the Bishops of <i>Antioch</i>, as repugnant to the antient Canons,
that is, to those very Canons, on which, at the Suggestion of <i>Innocent</i>,
they had founded it. And here I cannot help observing, by the way,
that the Bishops of <i>Antioch</i> never thought of alleging, in support of
their Claim, the Authority of <i>Innocent</i>, which they would certainly
have done, had they not been well apprised, that no Regard would
have been paid to it by the Fathers of the Council. As for what <i>Innocent</i>
adds concerning the Time and Manner in which the Custom he
complains of was introduced, he must certainly have been no less mistaken
in those Particulars, than he was in the Sense and Meaning of
the Canons of <i>Nice</i>. For who can imagine, that the <i>Arian</i> Bishops,
at the Time <i>Arianism</i> prevailed, that is, when they had the greatest Interest
at Court, and the Orthodox had none, would have suffered the
Bishops of <i>Cyprus</i> to withdraw themselves, contrary to the established
Laws of the Church, from their Jurisdiction, for no other Reason,
but because the Bishops of <i>Antioch</i> professed the Doctrine of
<i>Arius</i>?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Alexander</i>, in his Letter to <i>Innocent</i>, had asked him, Whether
Two Metropolitan Sees should be erected in one Province, which
had been divided by the Emperors into Two? <i>Innocent</i> replies, That
the Concerns of the Church being different from those of the State,
the Church ought to adhere to the antient Rule. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Alterations in the<br/>State generally at-<br/>tended with the like<br/>Alterations in the<br/>Church.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> However, it is plain
from History, that such Alterations in the State were, generally speaking,
attended with the like Alterations in the Church; insomuch that
when the Bishop of any considerable City wanted to be raised to the
Dignity of a Metropolitan, the most expeditious Way of gratifying his
Ambition was, to apply to the Emperor for a Division of the Province;
that his City being advanced, by such a Division, to the Rank
of a Metropolis, he might, by the same Means, be preferred to that
of a Metropolitan. Of mere Bishops, thus raised to the Dignity of
Metropolitans, without any Regard to <i>Innocent</i>’s Letter, or, as it is
styled, Decretal, several Instances occur in History.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i>, in the End of his Letter, declares it as his Opinion, that
such Ecclesiastics as had renounced <i>Arianism</i>, or any other Heresy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>with a Desire of being received into the Church, ought not to be
admitted as Ecclesiastics, but only as Laymen. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ecclesiastics ordained<br/>by Heretics to be ad-<br/>mitted into the Church<br/>only as Laymen.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This Doctrine is intirely
agreeable to the erroneous Doctrine concerning the Invalidity
of Ordination by the Hands of an Heretic, which we have heard him
labour to establish in his Letter to the Bishops of <i>Macedon</i><a id='r1452' /><a href='#f1452' class='c015'><sup>[1452]</sup></a>. He concludes
this Letter with intreating the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> to cause it to
be read in a Council, or to see that Copies of it be transmitted to all
the Bishops of his Diocese, that all may agree in observing the Instructions
which it contains<a id='r1453' /><a href='#f1453' class='c015'><sup>[1453]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent<i>’s Letter to<br/>the Bishop of</i> Eugub-<br/>ium.</div>

<p class='c001'>But of all <i>Innocent</i>’s Letters, that which he writ to <i>Decentius</i> Bishop
of <i>Eugubium</i> (a City still known by the same Name in the Duchy
of <i>Urbino</i>) is by far the most worthy of Notice, whether we consider
the Doctrine which he there lays down, or the Principles on
which he founds it. As to the Doctrine, it may be reduced to the Two
following Heads; <i>viz.</i> That all the Churches in the West are bound to
adopt, and strictly to observe, every Practice and Custom observed by the
<i>Roman</i> Church; and that the Customs of all other Churches, differing
from those of the <i>Roman</i> Church, are but Corruptions of the antient
Tradition, Deviations from the Practice of the Primitive Times, and
insufferable Abuses. As for the Principles on which he founds this
Doctrine, they are, to say no more, of a Piece with the Doctrine itself.
For he pretends, 1. That no Apostle, besides St. <i>Peter</i>, ever preached
in the West. He ought, with St. <i>Peter</i>, to have at least excepted
St. <i>Paul</i>; and, no doubt, would, had not his Memory failed him,
as well as his Infallibility. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>All Churches ought,<br/>according to him, to<br/>conform to the Cus-<br/>toms of the</i> Roman<br/><i>Church</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He supposes, in the Second place, That
all the Churches in the West were founded by St. <i>Peter</i>, or by some of
his Successors; and consequently, that they ought to conform to the
Customs of the <i>Roman</i> Church, since to that Church they owe their
Origin. But that the Church of <i>Lyons</i>, not to mention others, was
founded by Preachers sent thither out of <i>Asia</i> by St. <i>Polycarp</i>, and not
by St. <i>Peter</i>, or any of his Successors, is affirmed by all the Antients,
and allowed by the most learned among the Moderns; though some
of them pretend, without the least Foundation, the Whole to have
been done by the Authority of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i><a id='r1454' /><a href='#f1454' class='c015'><sup>[1454]</sup></a>. <i>Innocent</i> pretends,
in the Third place, every Point of Discipline and Ecclesiastical
Polity to have been settled by the Apostles, and whatever was settled
at <i>Rome</i> by St. <i>Peter</i> to have been there strictly observed ever since his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Time, without the least Addition or Diminution. He concludes this
Part of his Letter with laying it down as a general Maxim, That it is
unlawful for any Bishop to make the least Alterations in the Discipline
of his Church, or even to introduce into one Church a Custom or
Practice observed by another<a id='r1455' /><a href='#f1455' class='c015'><sup>[1455]</sup></a>. This nevertheless is what all Bishops
have done, and even those of <i>Rome</i>, both before and after <i>Innocent</i>’s
Time, and consequently what they thought it lawful to do. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Some Customs of the</i><br/>Roman <i>Church bor-<br/>rowed of other Churches</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
Psalmody, for Instance (and innumerable other Instances might be
alleged), or the singing of Psalms in the Churches, was not instituted
by any of the Apostles but first introduced by St. <i>Ignatius</i> into the
Church of <i>Antioch</i><a id='r1456' /><a href='#f1456' class='c015'><sup>[1456]</sup></a>, whence it spread in a very short time to all the
Churches in the East, those Bishops no more scrupling to adopt, than
<i>Ignatius</i> had scrupled to introduce, so laudable a Practice. Of the Eastern
Churches it was borrowed by the Church of <i>Milan</i>, and of the
Church of <i>Milan</i> by that of <i>Rome</i>, long before <i>Innocent</i>’s Time; which
plainly shews, that his Predecessors held not that Doctrine, no more than
one of the best of his Successors, St. <i>Gregory the Great</i>, who openly approves
of some Customs, that were first unknown to, but afterwards
adopted by his Church<a id='r1457' /><a href='#f1457' class='c015'><sup>[1457]</sup></a>. Upon the Whole, it is evident, that <i>Innocent</i>
was grosly mistaken, not only with respect to this Point, but likewise
in asserting, that whatever had been settled at <i>Rome</i> by St. <i>Peter</i>, was
still observed there without the least <i>Addition or Diminution</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Ceremony of<br/>anointing those who<br/>are confirmed.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The remaining Part of <i>Innocent</i>’s Letter relates to some particular
Ceremonies and Customs, especially to the Ceremony of confirming
those who were baptized, and the Custom of fasting on <i>Saturdays</i>.
With respect to the former, he informs <i>Decentius</i>, that, according to
the Custom of the Church, founded on the Practice of the Apostles,
the Bishop alone can anoint on the Forehead those who have been
baptized, and give them the Holy Ghost; and that the Priests can
only anoint other Parts, the Episcopal Power not having been granted
to them, though they partake of the Priesthood<a id='rN57' /><a href='#fN57' class='c015'><sup>[N57]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN57'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN57'>N57</a>. The Ceremony of anointing with
Oil the Forehead, and likewise the Organs
of the Five Senses, in those who had been
baptized, is undoubtedly very antient. <i>Tertullian</i>,
who lived in the Latter-end of the
Second Century, speaks of it as a Ceremony
universally practised and established<a id='rN57.1' /><a href='#fN57.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='rN57.2' /><a href='#fN57.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, who flourished Fifty Years
after, St. <i>Ambrose</i><a id='rN57.3' /><a href='#fN57.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, St. <i>Austin</i><a id='rN57.4' /><a href='#fN57.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, St.
<i>Jerom</i><a id='rN57.5' /><a href='#fN57.5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, and the other Fathers, describe
it as a Ceremony, by which the Holy
Ghost was given to those who had been
baptized, and consequently which none
but Bishops could administer, they being
the Successors of the Apostles, to whom
alone that Power was granted. For the
Fathers, generally speaking, and other
antient Writers, suppose this, and the Imposition
of Hands, by which the Holy
Ghost was given by the Apostles to those
who were baptized<a id='rN57.6' /><a href='#fN57.6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, to be one and the
same Ceremony. The Oil employed on
this Occasion was, as early as the Third
Century, solemnly consecrated, kept in the
Churches or Places where the Faithful met,
and held by them in great Veneration<a id='rN57.7' /><a href='#fN57.7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
This gave Rise, in the following Century,
to many superstitious Practices, and Miracles
were said to have been wrought by
the <i>holy Oil</i>, to warrant such Practices,
and confound those who thought it unlawful
to comply with them. A very remarkable
Miracle of this Nature is gravely related
by <i>Optatus Milevitanus</i><a id='rN57.8' /><a href='#fN57.8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>, who writ about
the middle of the Fourth Century. But, in
the Time of the Apostles, the Whole of this
Ceremony consisted in the Imposition of
Hands: <i>Then laid they their Hands on
them, and they received the Holy Ghost</i>.
Not a Word of <i>Oil</i>, of <i>Chrism</i>, of <i>Unction</i>,
of <i>signing with Oil on the Forehead</i> in the
Form of a <i>Cross</i>, and much less of a <i>Blow</i>
given by the Bishop on the Cheek to the
Person that is confirmed, though these are
now all deemed, in the Church of <i>Rome</i>,
material Parts of this Ceremony. As such
Rites were unknown to, and unpractised
by, the Apostles, it matters little how early
they were introduced after their Time. And
here I cannot help observing, that the <i>Roman
Catholics</i> themselves have not thought
fit to adopt all the Ceremonies used on this
Occasion, and recommended by the Fathers.
For, in <i>Innocent</i>’s Time, the Person confirmed
was not only anointed on the Forehead,
but on other Parts; on the Forehead
by the Bishop, on other Parts by the Priests.
The other Parts were, as we gather from
<i>Cyril</i> Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i><a id='rN57.9' /><a href='#fN57.9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>, the Eyes,
Ears, Nose, Mouth, Hands, and Feet. The
anointing of these Parts was, in the Opinion
of that Father, no less fraught with
Mysteries than the anointing of the Forehead;
and yet the former Unction, notwithstanding
its Antiquity, and all the Mysteries
it symbolized, has been long since
omitted, as altogether unnecessary. They
might in like manner have omitted all the
rest, and contented themselves, as the
Apostles did, with the bare Imposition of
Hands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Confirmation <i>not a<br/>Sacrament</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>The <i>Roman Catholics</i>, finding this Ceremony, now known by the
Name of <i>Confirmation</i>, styled a <i>Sacrament</i> by St. <i>Cyprian</i><a id='r1458' /><a href='#f1458' class='c015'><sup>[1458]</sup></a>, and
St. <i>Austin</i><a id='r1459' /><a href='#f1459' class='c015'><sup>[1459]</sup></a>, have thereupon raised it to that Rank, not reflecting that
the antient Writers frequently make use of that Word to express no
more than a <i>sacred Ceremony</i>, or Mystery. And truly were they to
reckon among their <i>Sacraments</i> all the Ceremonies which the Fathers
and other Christian Writers have distinguished with that Title, their
Number would amount to Seventy rather than to Seven.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Why deemed formerly<br/>unlawful to fast on</i><br/>Sunday <i>or</i> Saturday.</div>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the other Point, those who are ever so little versed
in the Writings of the Fathers, must know, that from the earliest
Times it was deemed unlawful, nay, and highly criminal, for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Christian to fast on <i>Sunday</i> or <i>Saturday</i>; on <i>Sunday</i>, because those
Heretics, who denied the Resurrection of our Saviour, fasted on that
Day, in Opposition to the Orthodox, who, believing it, solemnized
the <i>Sunday</i>, the Day on which it happened, with Feasting and Rejoicings;
on <i>Saturday</i>, because other Heretics holding the God of the
<i>Jews</i>, and the Author of their Law, to be an evil Spirit, whom
Christ came to destroy, fasted on the Seventh Day, thinking that by
fasting they vilified the God of the <i>Jews</i> as much as the <i>Jews</i> honoured
him by feasting<a id='r1460' /><a href='#f1460' class='c015'><sup>[1460]</sup></a>. Among the antient Canons, known by
the Name of the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, we read the following Ordinance:
<i>If a Clerk shall be found to have fasted on a</i> Sunday <i>or a</i>
Saturday, <i>let him be deposed; if a Layman, let him be cut off from
the Communion of the Faithful</i><a id='r1461' /><a href='#f1461' class='c015'><sup>[1461]</sup></a>. But that Canon must be understood
only with respect to the East; for there was broached, and there
chiefly prevailed, the Heresy that first introduced such a Practice. But in
the West, where that Heresy was scarce known, some Churches, and
the <i>Roman</i> in particular, observed both <i>Fridays</i> and <i>Saturdays</i> as Fast-days.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Friday <i>from the<br/>earliest Times a<br/>Fast-day</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The <i>Friday</i> was, from the earliest Times, a Fast-day with all
Churches, both in the East and the West; the <i>Saturday</i> was only in the
West, and even there with very few Churches, which had borrowed that
Custom of the <i>Roman</i> Church, as we are informed by St. <i>Austin</i><a id='r1462' /><a href='#f1462' class='c015'><sup>[1462]</sup></a>.
<i>Innocent</i> therefore, desirous of establishing in all other Churches the
Custom that obtained in his own, undertakes to prove, first, That all
may, and, secondly, That all ought to observe <i>Saturday</i> as a Fast.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Saturday <i>a Fast-day<br/>in the</i> Roman<br/><i>Church</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  That all may, he proves well enough; but the Reasons he offers to
shew that they all ought, <i>viz.</i> <i>Because Christ lay in the Sepulchre the</i>
Saturday <i>as well as the</i> Friday, <i>and the Apostles fasted</i>, as he supposes,
<i>on both Days</i>, are manifestly unconclusive as to any Obligation. Besides,
it was not because Christ lay in the Sepulchre, or because the
Apostles fasted, but because Christ was crucified on a <i>Friday</i>, that a
Fast was appointed to be observed on that Day. In Process of Time,
the Custom of sanctifying both Days with a Fast took place in most
of the Western Churches; and this Custom has been made in latter
times a general Law, and one of the Commandments of the Church,
which all <i>Roman Catholics</i> are bound to obey on Pain of Damnation.
However, the Severity of it is so far relaxed, that, as they are only required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>to abstain from Meat, the utmost Riot and Epicurism in other
Kinds of Food, and in Wine, may be, and are indulged on their
Fast-days.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Ceremony of<br/>anointing the Sick<br/>with Oil.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The last Article of <i>Innocent</i>’s Letter relates to the Ceremony of
anointing the Sick with Oil, agreeably to that of St. <i>James</i>, <i>Is any
sick among you</i>, &amp;c.<a id='r1463' /><a href='#f1463' class='c015'><sup>[1463]</sup></a>? As the Apostle directs the Faithful to <i>call for
the Elders of the Church</i>; some took from thence Occasion to question
whether Bishops were impowered to perform that Ceremony.
Innocent therefore answers <i>Decentius</i>, who had proposed the Question,
that there can be no room to doubt whether or no the Bishops
have such a Power, since the Priests can have none, which the Bishops
have not, of whom they receive all their Power. It is true, says <i>Innocent</i>,
that St. <i>James</i> ordered the Faithful to call for the Elders, and
not for the Bishops; but that was because he knew that the Bishops
could not have so much Leisure from other important Duties as the
Priests. He adds, that this Unction must not be applied to Penitents;
that the Oil used in it must be blessed by the Bishop; and when it is
thus blessed, not the Presbyters only, but all the Faithful, may anoint
with it both themselves and others. The Power of anointing, St.
<i>James</i> confined to the Elders or Priests, and that is the present Doctrine
of the Church of <i>Rome</i>, though <i>Innocent</i> extended such a Power to
all the Faithful. This Ceremony, now known by the Name of <i>Extreme
Unction</i>, was, in <i>Innocent</i>’s Time, <i>a kind of Sacrament</i>; for
so he styles it<a id='r1464' /><a href='#f1464' class='c015'><sup>[1464]</sup></a>. But it is now a true <i>Sacrament</i>, and such it was
declared by the Council of <i>Trent</i><a id='r1465' /><a href='#f1465' class='c015'><sup>[1465]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Letters from the<br/>Councils of</i> Carthage<br/><i>and</i> Milevum<br/><i>to</i><br/>Innocent.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Year 416. <i>Innocent</i> received Three Letters from the <i>African</i>
Bishops; <i>viz.</i> one from the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, properly so called,
assembled at <i>Carthage</i>; another from those of <i>Numidia</i>, assembled at
<i>Milevum</i>; and a Third from St. <i>Austin</i>, signed by him and Four other
Bishops. The Two Councils writ to acquaint <i>Innocent</i>, that they had
condemned <i>Pelagius</i> and his Disciple <i>Cælestius</i>, of whose Opinions I
shall speak hereafter, and desire him to add the Authority of the
Apostolic See to their Decrees. The Letter from St. <i>Austin</i>, and the
Four other Bishops, was to inform <i>Innocent</i>, in a friendly manner,
that he was suspected of countenancing those Heretics, and favouring
their Doctrine. This Suspicion they themselves seem not to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>thought quite groundless: for <i>Possidius</i>, one of the Bishops who subscribed
the Letter, writes, that the <i>African</i> Bishops took a great deal
of Pains to convince <i>Innocent</i>, and his Successor <i>Zosimus</i>, that the
Doctrine of <i>Pelagius</i> was erroneous and heretical, knowing that his
Followers were striving to infect the Apostolic See itself with their
poisonous Tenets<a id='r1466' /><a href='#f1466' class='c015'><sup>[1466]</sup></a>. They strove in vain, says <i>Baronius</i>; and perhaps
they did; but the <i>African</i> Bishops had never taken so much Pains to
guard the Apostolic See against that Infection, had they not thought
it capable of being infected. The Five Bishops sent to <i>Innocent</i>, together
with their Letter, St. <i>Austin</i>’s Answer to a Letter which he had
received from <i>Pelagius</i>, his Confutation of a Book composed by that
Heretic, and the Book itself, with the Passages marked in it that gave
most Offence, and claimed a particular Attention, lest he should overlook
them<a id='r1467' /><a href='#f1467' class='c015'><sup>[1467]</sup></a>. This was not treating him as an infallible Judge<a id='rN58' /><a href='#fN58' class='c015'><sup>[N58]</sup></a>.</p>

informing him by a private Letter, and not
by a public one from the Council, of the
Suspicions that some entertained of him,
was a Mark of the great Respect and Veneration,
they had for the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>,

it became dutiful Children, to expose to the

<i>Baronius</i>, that, in the like Circumstances,
they would not have shewn the same Respect
for any other Bishop? He had better
have observed, and the Observation is more
obvious, that his being suspected at all evidently
proves the <i>Infallibility</i> of the Apostolic
See not to have been, in those Days,
an Article of the Catholic Faith.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent<i>’s Answer to<br/>the Councils</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Letters from the Council of <i>Carthage</i>, from that of <i>Milevum</i>,
and from the Five Bishops, were brought to <i>Rome</i> by <i>Julius</i>, Bishop
of some City in <i>Africa</i>; and, by the same <i>Julius</i>, <i>Innocent</i> answered
them with Three Letters, all dated the 27th of <i>January</i> of the Year
417. The First, which is addressed to <i>Aurelius</i>, probably Bishop of
<i>Carthage</i>, and to the other Bishops of that Assembly, he begins with
commending them for their Zeal, their Pastoral Vigilance, and the
Regard they had shewn for the <i>Apostolic See</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He claims the first a Divine Right of finally <a id='corr323.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='decideing'>deciding</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_323.26'><ins class='correction' title='decideing'>deciding</ins></a></span> all Controversies.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He thence takes an Opportunity
to resume his usual and favourite Subject, the Dignity, Pre-eminence,
and Authority of that See; roundly asserting, that <i>all Ecclesiastical
Matters throughout the World are, by Divine Right, to be referred to the
Apostolic See, before they are finally decided in the Provinces</i>. This
was indeed a very bold Claim, and a direct asserting to himself the
Universal Supremacy attained by his Successors. But it was yet too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>early for such a Claim to be granted; and it is plain the <i>African</i> Bishops
had no Idea of this Divine Right. For, had they entertained any such
Notion, they surely would never have presumed finally to condemn
and anathematize, as they did, <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, without
consulting at least the Apostolic See: neither would they have written to
<i>Innocent</i> in the Style they did, after they had condemned them: for,
in their Letter, they did not leave him at Liberty to approve or disapprove
of what they had done; but only desire him to join his
Authority to theirs, which they well knew he could not refuse to
do, without confirming the Suspicion of his countenancing the <i>Pelagians</i>,
and their Doctrine. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Which is not ac-<br/>knowledged by the</i> Af-<br/>rican <i>nor the</i> Numidian<br/><i>Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>We have anathematized</i> Pelagius <i>and
Cælestius</i>, say the Fathers of the Council of <i>Carthage</i>, <i>and thought
fit to acquaint you with it, that to the Decrees of our Mediocrity
might be added the Authority of the Apostolic See</i>. This is a modest
Style, and respectful to the See of <i>Rome</i>; but it is that of Men who
plainly thought they had a Right to act in this Matter, by their own
Judgment and Power, without waiting for the Award of that See,
as they ought to have done, is they had allowed of <i>Innocent</i>’s Claim.
In like manner the Council of <i>Milevum</i>, after informing <i>Innocent</i>
of the Sentence, which they had pronounced against the Two above-mentioned
Heretics, adds; <i>And this Error and Impiety, which has
every-where so many Followers and Abetters, ought also to be anathematized
and condemned by the Apostolic See</i><a id='r1468' /><a href='#f1468' class='c015'><sup>[1468]</sup></a>; which was putting
<i>Innocent</i> in mind of what he ought to do, and not consulting him
what they should do. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>An Instance  of</i> In-<br/>nocent<i>’s great Subtlety<br/>and Address</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Conduct of the <i>African</i> Bishops gave
<i>Innocent</i> no small Uneasiness. He was at a Loss what to do at so
critical a Juncture. For to approve of a Conduct, so derogatory to
the pretended Dignity of his See, was giving up his Claim to the
<i>Divine Right</i> of finally deciding all Ecclesiastical Controversies. To
disapprove it, was confirming the Suspicion of his countenancing the
Doctrine which they had condemned. But <i>Innocent</i> was a Man of
great Subtlety and Address; and he found out, at last, an Expedient
to extricate himself out of that Perplexity, and gratify the Fathers of
both Councils, without either approving or condemning their past
Conduct. The only thing they required of him was to join his
Authority with theirs, in condemning the <i>Pelagian</i> Heresy; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>he readily did. But, lest in so doing he should seem to approve of
their having condemned it without first consulting him, in his Answer
to their Letters, he supposes them to have actually consulted
him; nay, to have referred to him the final Decision of that Controversy;
and, agreeably to that Supposition, he commends them for
the Deference they had thereby shewn to the Apostolic See. <i>You
have well observed</i>, says he, <i>the Ordinances of the antient Fathers,
and not trampled under-foot what they, not in human Wisdom, but
by Divine Order, have established</i>; viz. <i>That whatever is done in
Places, however remote, should, for a final Conclusion, be referred
to the Apostolic See</i>. And again, <i>You have had due Regard to the
Honour of the Apostolic See, I mean of him who has the Charge
and Care of all Churches, in consulting him in these Perplexities,
and intricate Cases</i><a id='r1469' /><a href='#f1469' class='c015'><sup>[1469]</sup></a>. Thus did <i>Innocent</i> maintain his Claim, and,
at the same time, avoid quarrelling, at an improper Season, with
those who had acted in direct Opposition to it. A necessary Policy
in the first setting up of such extravagant and groundless Pretensions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He excommunicates</i><br/>Cælestius <i>and</i> Pelag-<br/>ius.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the present Letter he not only approves of the Judgment given
against <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i> by the <i>African</i> Bishops, but alleges
several Reasons in Confutation of the Doctrines they taught; and concludes,
by declaring them cut off from the Communion of the Church,
agreeably to the Sentence of the <i>African</i> Bishops, as Men not only
unworthy of that Communion, but of human Society, and even of
Life<a id='r1470' /><a href='#f1470' class='c015'><sup>[1470]</sup></a>. The same things he repeats in his Answer to the Bishops of
<i>Numidia</i>; but he seems there to have been sensible, upon a more
cool Consideration, that, in his Letter to the Council of <i>Carthage</i>,
he had strained his Prerogative too high; and therefore in this he
confines to Matters of <i>Faith</i> the general Maxim, which he had laid
down, concerning the Obligation of referring all Ecclesiastical Matters,
for a final Decision, to the Apostolic See. In the same Letter
he endeavours to confute, in particular, the Doctrine of <i>Pelagius</i>,
allowing Children, who die without Baptism, to partake of eternal
Life<a id='r1471' /><a href='#f1471' class='c015'><sup>[1471]</sup></a>. In his Answer to the Five Bishops, he refers them for his real
Sentiments, concerning the Doctrine of <i>Pelagius</i>, to the other Two
Letters, adding, that he had read the Book of <i>Pelagius</i>, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>had sent him, and found nothing in it that he liked, or rather that
he did not dislike<a id='r1472' /><a href='#f1472' class='c015'><sup>[1472]</sup></a><a id='rN59' /><a href='#fN59' class='c015'><sup>[N59]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fN59'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN59'>N59</a>. That the <i>Pelagian</i> Heresy was first
condemned by the <i>African</i> Bishops, is a
Fact so well attested, that one would think
it impossible it should ever have come into
any Man’s Thoughts to call it in question.
And yet <i>Baronius</i>, upon the Authority of a
very doubtful Passage out of St. <i>Prosper</i>, a
contemporary Writer, roundly asserts that
Heresy to have been first condemned, not
by the <i>African</i> Bishops, but by <i>Innocent</i><a id='rN59.1' /><a href='#fN59.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

<div class='sidenote'>Cælestius <i>condemned by<br/>the</i> African <i>Bi-<br/>shops, notwithstanding<br/>his Appeal to</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Cælestius</i> had been condemned by a Council held at <i>Carthage</i>
in the Year 412. and probably consisting of the same Bishops who
composed that of the Year 416. From their Sentence he appealed, as
<i>Baronius</i> observes<a id='r1473' /><a href='#f1473' class='c015'><sup>[1473]</sup></a>, to the See of <i>Rome</i>, summoning his Accuser
<i>Paulinus</i> to appear at the same Tribunal. But all we can infer from
thence is, that either <i>Innocent</i> did not receive the Appeal, or, if he
did, that the <i>African</i> Bishops made no Account of it, since they condemned
him anew, without waiting for the Judgment of <i>Innocent</i>,
to whom he had appealed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent<i>’s Letter to</i><br/>Jerom.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i> writ Two Letters more, a little before his Death, one
of which was to St. <i>Jerom</i>, comforting him in his Distress. For some
who favoured <i>Pelagius</i>, provoked at <i>Jerom</i>’s repeated Invectives
against him, had set Fire to his Monastery at <i>Bethlehem</i>, and burnt
it down to the Ground, agreeably to the Spirit and Methods in which
religious Controversies were now carried on. Their Design was to
have burnt <i>Jerom</i> himself; but he had the good Luck to escape out
of the Flames, and save himself in a strong Tower. The Two noble
Virgins, <i>Eustochium</i> and her Niece <i>Paula</i>, who led a retired Life
under the Direction of <i>Jerom</i>, met with no better Treatment. For
those Fanatics, breaking into the House where they lived, beat some
of their Attendants in their Presence, killed others, and threatened
them with Fire and Destruction. With this they acquainted <i>Innocent</i>,
who thereupon writ to <i>Jerom</i>, offering to exert <i>the whole Authority
of the Apostolic See</i> against the Authors of such Excesses, provided
he knew who they were: for the Two Virgins had concealed
their Names, probably to prevent his exerting that Authority, which
they had Reason to apprehend would be attended with greater Evils.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span><i>Innocent</i> adds, that so long as the Authors and Promoters of those
unheard of Barbarities are unknown, he can only condole with those
who have suffered by them; but, if they were accused in due Form,
at his Tribunal, he would not fail to appoint proper Judges to try
them; which, by the way, he had no Right to do.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Letter to</i> John<br/><i>of</i> Jerusalem.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i>’s other Letter is to <i>John</i> Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, who hated
<i>Jerom</i> on account of his Inveteracy against <i>Origen</i>, and was suspected
to connive at the cruel Treatment he and his Followers had met
with. Him therefore <i>Innocent</i> reprimands very severely, for suffering
such enormous Abuses within the Limits of his Jurisdiction. In
his Letter he gives him the Title of <i>well-beloved Brother</i>; but, at
the same time, treats him with more Haughtiness than was becoming
even in a Superior, though he neither had, nor could claim by the
Canons, any kind of Jurisdiction or Authority over him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innocent <i>dies</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>These Letters <i>Innocent</i> writ in the Latter-end of <i>January</i>, and
died on the 12th of <i>March</i> of the same Year 417. having governed
the <i>Roman</i> Church near Fifteen Years; for his Predecessor <i>Anastasius</i>
died on the 27th of <i>April</i> 402. and he was chosen soon after his Decease,
as I have observed above. He was generally esteemed a Man
of good Parts, and well acquainted with the Laws and Traditions of
the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The See of</i> Rome<br/><i>greatly indebted to<br/>him for its Grandeur</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Hence he was frequently consulted by the Western,
and sometimes by the Eastern Bishops, in Points both of Faith and
Discipline. Of this general Esteem, and the Deference that was
thereupon paid to his Decisions, he took Advantage to lay down,
with an Air of Authority, and as undoubted Truths, many false,
groundless, and dangerous Maxims, all tending to the Diminution of
the Episcopal Power, and the Advancement of the Papal. <i>The Dignity
of the Apostolic See</i> was, as we have seen, the Burden of almost
all his Letters; he even improved it into a Claim of Supremacy; and
we may say, with great Truth, that to him the See of <i>Rome</i> was
more indebted for the Grandeur it afterwards gained, than to all his
Predecessors together. He formed the Plan of that Spiritual Monarchy,
which they, by constant Application, established at last, in spite of
the many almost insurmountable Difficulties, which they had to contend
with. He was the first who, changing the antient Foundation
of the Primacy, claimed it as the Successor of St. <i>Peter</i>, <i>the Prince
of the Apostles</i>, as he is styled, and not as the Bishop of the first
City, though on that Consideration alone it had been granted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the Councils. I said <i>Primacy</i>, because the Word <i>Supremacy</i> was utterly
unknown in those Days. The Council of <i>Sardica</i>, held in the
Year 347. had allowed, in some Cases, and under several Restrictions,
Appeals to be made to the See of <i>Rome</i>, as has been observed elsewhere<a id='r1474' /><a href='#f1474' class='c015'><sup>[1474]</sup></a>.
But <i>Innocent</i>, scorning to owe any Branch of his Authority
to that, or any other Council, claimed, by <i>Divine Right</i>, the
Power of finally deciding all Ecclesiastical Controversies and Disputes;
which was claiming, by Divine Right, an unlimited Jurisdiction. It
is true, no Regard was had to such Claims; nor indeed did <i>Innocent</i>
dare to pursue them, being well apprised of the Opposition he would
meet with, if he should then have made such an Attempt. He therefore
wisely contented himself with laying Foundations, and thought
it a great Advance, as it certainly was, to have openly asserted such
Notions, and brought the Ears of Men to endure them, if not their
Minds. Had he gone farther, he would have been stopped in his Career,
and it might have proved fatal to the Power of <i>Rome</i> before it
was come to an Age of Maturity; but that he went thus far was of
great Benefit to it, because it made a Beginning, and furnished his
Successors with a Pretence to plead some Antiquity for the Opinions
and Principles upon which they proceeded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Decretals often<br/>quoted by the Popish<br/>Divines.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly the Decretals of <i>Innocent</i> are frequently quoted by the
Advocates for the See of <i>Rome</i>, to shew how early the Popes claimed,
by Divine Right, and as Successors of St. <i>Peter</i>, an universal Authority
and Jurisdiction. But if the Principles, on which they founded
their Claims, were false in <i>Innocent</i>’s Time, they are still so in
ours; if no Account was then made of such Claims (and that none
was made, I have sufficiently shewn), no Account ought to be made
of them now; no more than if they were dated but Yesterday. Nor,
indeed, ought the Beginning of the Fifth Century to be esteemed an
early Time in the Christian Church. Great Corruptions were then
crept into it; and, with regard to the Point in Question, it was very
late. For had the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> been supreme Head of the Church,
in Right of St. <i>Peter</i>, how came that Supremacy to be unknown,
and unheard of, for above Four hundred Years? If the Four first Centuries
could not discover it, on what new Light was it revealed to the
Fifth?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Innocent</i> has been inrolled, by his Successors, in the Catalogue of

at their Hands, in their Estimation of Merit, than any of his Predecessors,

<div class='sidenote'>Pelagius, <i>his Country</i>,<br/><i>Profession</i>, <i>Parts</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p class='c001'>The first thing that engaged the Attention of <i>Zosimus</i>, after his
Election, was the Heresy of <i>Pelagius</i>, and his chief Disciple <i>Cælestius</i>,
which, at that time, made a great Noise in the Church. <i>Pelagius</i>
was by Birth a <i>Briton</i>, and a Monk by Profession; but one of those
who, parting with their Estates, and renouncing all worldly Honours,
lived an austere Life; but in no Community, and under no Rule.
Such a Monk was the famous <i>Paulinus</i>, such <i>Pammachius</i>, and such
probably <i>Pelagius</i>; for I do not find, in any antient Writer, that he
ever confined himself to a Monastery; nay, the wandering Life he
led is a strong Proof he never did<a id='rN61' /><a href='#fN61' class='c015'><sup>[N61]</sup></a>. As to his Parts, <i>Jerom</i>, who
could never discover any thing commendable in those he opposed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>speaks of him with the greatest Contempt, as if he had no Genius,
and but very little Knowlege<a id='r1476' /><a href='#f1476' class='c015'><sup>[1476]</sup></a>. But St. <i>Austin</i>, a more candid and
less passionate Writer, owns him to have been a Man of extraordinary
good Sense, of a very sprightly Genius, of great Penetration,
and one who was not easily overcome, but rather capable of maintaining,
with the strongest Reasons that could be offered, the Opinions
which he once embraced<a id='r1477' /><a href='#f1477' class='c015'><sup>[1477]</sup></a>. He lived several Years at <i>Rome</i>, at least
from the Year 400. to 411. and was there well known, and greatly
esteemed. For St. <i>Austin</i>, who first heard of him, while he lived at
<i>Rome</i>, spoke of him in the first Books, which he writ against him,
as of a Man, <i>who passed for a Saint, who had made great Progress
in Piety, whose Life was chaste, and Manners blameless, who had
sold and given to the Poor all he had</i>, &amp;c<a id='r1478' /><a href='#f1478' class='c015'><sup>[1478]</sup></a>. St. <i>Paulinus</i> and St.
<i>Jerom</i> seem to have once entertained a no less favourable Opinion
of him in these respects, than St. <i>Austin</i> did; for they too, in some
of their Letters, speak of him with the greatest Commendations.
But he no sooner began to broach his new Doctrines than he forfeited
their good Opinion, and with it every Virtue which he had formerly
possessed; nay, they pretend that he abandoned himself, at once, to
immoderate Eating and Drinking, and to all manner of Debauchery,
passing his whole Time in Revels and Banquets, in caressing and
pampering his Body, which by that means, says <i>Jerom</i>, swelled to
such an exorbitant Size, that he was more capable of crushing his
Adversaries with the Weight of his Carcase than the Weight of his
Arguments<a id='r1479' /><a href='#f1479' class='c015'><sup>[1479]</sup></a>. We shall find very few, if any at all, who, upon their
teaching Doctrines not approved by the Fathers, have not been immediately
transformed by them, out of their great Zeal for the Purity
of the Faith, into Monsters of Wickedness, though they themselves
had, perhaps, proposed them before for Patterns of every Christian
Virtue. It behoves us therefore to be very cautious in giving
Credit to what they say of those whom they style Heretics. With
respect to <i>Pelagius</i>, St. <i>Austin</i>, more moderate than the rest, does
not charge him with any Vices, but only ascribes to Hypocrisy the
Virtues which he had admired in him before<a id='r1480' /><a href='#f1480' class='c015'><sup>[1480]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Cælestius, his Family,<br/>Profession, Parts</i>, &amp;c.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Cælestius</i>, the first and chief Disciple of <i>Pelagius</i>, was, according
to some, a Native of <i>Scotland</i> or <i>Ireland</i>; according to others, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span><i>Campania</i> in <i>Italy</i><a id='r1481' /><a href='#f1481' class='c015'><sup>[1481]</sup></a>; but, with respect to his Country, nothing
certain can be advanced. He was descended of an illustrious Family,
and had applied himself, from his Youth, to the Study of the Law,
and made some Figure at the Bar; but growing weary of that Profession,
he retired from the World, embraced a monastic Life, and
lived some Years in a Monastery<a id='r1482' /><a href='#f1482' class='c015'><sup>[1482]</sup></a>. St. <i>Jerom</i> speaks of him as a Man
of no Genius or Talents<a id='r1483' /><a href='#f1483' class='c015'><sup>[1483]</sup></a>. But St. <i>Austin</i> entertained a very different
Opinion of his Parts; for he commends him as a good
Writer, as one who was thoroughly acquainted with all the Subtilties
of Logic, and whose Talents would have proved very serviceable,
could he have been retrieved from his Errors<a id='r1484' /><a href='#f1484' class='c015'><sup>[1484]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Their Doctrine.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Tenets of <i>Pelagius</i> or <i>Cælestius</i> (for those, who embraced
them, are styled indifferently <i>Pelagians</i> and <i>Cælestians</i>) may be reduced
to the following Heads: 1. That we may, by our Free-will,
without the Help of Grace, do Good, and avoid Evil. 2. That
if Grace were necessary for either, God would be unjust in giving it
to one, and denying it to another. 3. That Faith, which is the first
Step to our Justification, depends upon our Free-will. 4. That the
Sin of <i>Adam</i> hurt none but him; that Children are born in the State
which he was in before the Fall; that they are not delivered by Baptism
from eternal Perdition, but, without Baptism, partake of Life
everlasting. By Life everlasting they meant, a middle State between
eternal Happiness and eternal Misery. 5. That Grace is only
necessary to render the Observance of the Commandments more
easy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Both pass over into</i><br/>Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'>These Opinions <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i> first broached at <i>Rome</i>,
about the Year 405. and gained there a great many Followers; more,
says St. <i>Austin</i>, than could be well imagined<a id='r1485' /><a href='#f1485' class='c015'><sup>[1485]</sup></a>. They both left
<i>Rome</i> in 410. or 411. and, crossing over into <i>Africa</i>, infected many
there, says the same Author, especially at <i>Carthage</i>, with their new
Doctrine<a id='r1486' /><a href='#f1486' class='c015'><sup>[1486]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pelagius <i>repairs to<br/>Palæstine</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Pelagius</i>, after a short Stay at <i>Carthage</i>, went first into
<i>Egypt</i>, and from thence into <i>Palæstine</i>, where he continued a long
time<a id='r1487' /><a href='#f1487' class='c015'><sup>[1487]</sup></a>. <i>Cælestius</i> remained at <i>Carthage</i>, hoping to be preferred there
to the Priesthood; but as he did not use the due Caution in propagating
his Doctrine in that City, he was soon discovered, and accused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>by one <i>Paulinus</i>, a Deacon, before a Council, at which several
Bishops were present, and <i>Aurelius</i> of <i>Carthage</i> presided. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cælestius <i>accused and<br/>condemned in</i> Africa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
Charge brought against him was, That he held the Sin of <i>Adam</i> to
have hurt him alone; that it could not be imputed to his Descendents;
and that no Sin was cancelled by Baptism. These Tenets
he did not own before the Council; but neither would he disown
or anathematize them; and therefore the Bishops, provoked at his
Obstinacy, not only condemned his Doctrine, but, at the same time,
cut him off, as an incorrigible Heretic, from the Communion of
the Church<a id='r1488' /><a href='#f1488' class='c015'><sup>[1488]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Appeals to</i> Rome, <i>but<br/>flies to</i> Ephesus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From this Sentence <i>Cælestius</i> appealed to the Judgment
of <i>Innocent</i>, then Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, summoning <i>Paulinus</i>, his
Accuser, to make his Charge good at that Tribunal. But <i>Cælestius</i>
himself laid, it seems, no Stress on his Appeal; for, instead of repairing
to <i>Rome</i>, he fled to <i>Ephesus</i><a id='r1489' /><a href='#f1489' class='c015'><sup>[1489]</sup></a>, where we shall leave him for the
present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pelagius <i>accused in</i><br/>Palæstine <i>by</i> Heros<br/><i>and</i> Lazarus, <i>two</i><br/>Gallican <i>Bishops</i>;</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Pelagius</i>, in the mean time, was not idle in <i>Palæstine</i>, whither he
had retired, as I have said above; but, being countenanced by <i>John</i>
Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, he gained daily such Numbers of Followers
there, that <i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, Two Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, whom I shall
speak of hereafter, happening to be then in <i>Palæstine</i>, thought it
incumbent upon them to accuse him to <i>Eulogius</i> Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i>,
and Metropolitan of <i>Palæstine</i>. They drew up a Writing accordingly,
containing the chief Heads of the Doctrine which <i>Pelagius</i>
taught, together with the Articles, for which his Disciple <i>Cælestius</i>
had been condemned by the Council of <i>Carthage</i>; and this Writing
they presented to <i>Eulogius</i>. Hereupon a Council was assembled soon
after at <i>Diospolis</i>, a City of <i>Palæstine</i>, known in Scripture by the
Name of <i>Lydda</i>. It consisted of Fourteen Bishops, and <i>Eulogius</i> of
<i>Cæsarea</i> presided; but neither of the <i>Gallican</i> Bishops was present,
the one being prevented by a dangerous Malady, and the other not
chusing to abandon him in that Condition. However, their Charge
against <i>Pelagius</i> was read, and he examined, by the Fathers of the
Assembly, on the Articles it contained. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and absolved by<br/>the Council of</i> Diospolis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But as nobody appeared
against him, as none of those Bishops were sufficiently acquainted with
the <i>Latin</i> Tongue to understand his Books, and he disowned some
Propositions, explained others in a Catholic Sense, and anathematized
all who maintained Doctrines repugnant to those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Catholic Church, the Council pronounced, at the Suggestion of <i>John</i>
of <i>Jerusalem</i>, the following Sentence: <i>Since the Monk</i> Pelagius,
<i>here present, has satisfied us, as to his Doctrine, and anathematized
with us whatever is contrary to the true Faith, we acknowlege him
to be in the Communion of the Church</i><a id='r1490' /><a href='#f1490' class='c015'><sup>[1490]</sup></a>. This Council St. <i>Jerom</i>
styles, <i>The pitiful Synod of</i> Diospolis<a id='r1491' /><a href='#f1491' class='c015'><sup>[1491]</sup></a>. But St. <i>Austin</i>, instead of
insulting them, calls them <i>Holy and Catholic Judges</i>; and will not
answer, that he himself might not have been deceived by the Artifices
of <i>Pelagius</i>, had he been one of his Judges<a id='r1492' /><a href='#f1492' class='c015'><sup>[1492]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He is accused by</i><br/>Heros <i>and</i> Lazarus <i>to<br/>the Bishops of</i> Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, surprised to hear that the Fathers of the Assembly
had absolved <i>Pelagius</i>, and despairing of ever being able to
get him condemned in the East, where his Cause was openly espoused
by the Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, resolved to apply to their Brethren in
the West, especially to the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, who they well knew
could not be prejudiced in his Favour, since they had already condemned
his favourite Disciple <i>Cælestius</i>. Pursuant to this Resolution,
they writ, by the famous <i>Orosius</i>, who was returning from <i>Palæstine</i>
to <i>Africa</i>, to the Bishops of that Province, accusing <i>Pelagius</i> and
<i>Cælestius</i> as the Authors of an <i>Execrable Sect</i>; giving them a particular
Account of what had passed in the Council of <i>Diospolis</i>, and
acquainting them with the wonderful Progress the new Heresy made
in the East, especially in <i>Palæstine</i><a id='r1493' /><a href='#f1493' class='c015'><sup>[1493]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Doctrine of</i><br/>Pelagius <i>and</i> Cælest-<br/>ius<i> condemned anew<br/>in</i> Africa.</div>

<p class='c001'>These Letters were delivered by <i>Orosius</i> to the Bishops of the Province
of <i>Carthage</i>, who, after having caused them to be read in the
Provincial Council, which was then sitting in that City, and, with
them, the Acts of the Council, which had been held Five Years before
against <i>Cælestius</i>, not only condemned the Doctrine ascribed to him
and <i>Pelagius</i>, but declared, that the same Sentence should be pronounced
against them, unless they anathematized, in the plainest and
most distinct Terms, the Errors with which they were charged<a id='r1494' /><a href='#f1494' class='c015'><sup>[1494]</sup></a>. The
Example of the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> was followed by those of <i>Numidia</i>,
assembled at <i>Milevum</i>, and by <i>Innocent</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, as I have related
above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>They appeal to</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>This Condemnation, so solemn and general, was attended with
the wished for Effect. It greatly lessened the Reputation of <i>Pelagius</i>
and <i>Cælestius</i>, staggered many of their Followers, and deterred others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>from embracing their Doctrines. Of this both <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>
were well apprised; and, at the same time, sensible, that the only
means of retrieving their Credit, and maintaining the Ground they
had gained, was to justify themselves either to the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>,
or to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, they chose the latter, thinking it more
easy to gain over one than many. Besides, in <i>Africa</i> they knew
St. <i>Austin</i>, who was in great Reputation there, and swayed all the
Councils as he pleased, to be their declared and irreconcileable
Enemy; whereas they had many Friends at <i>Rome</i>; and, among the
rest, the Presbyter <i>Sixtus</i>, who was afterwards raised to that See<a id='r1495' /><a href='#f1495' class='c015'><sup>[1495]</sup></a>.
In order, therefore, to persuade the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, as <i>Pelagius</i> had
done the Bishops of <i>Diospolis</i>, that they had been falsly and maliciously
accused, <i>Pelagius</i> writ a Letter to <i>Innocent</i>, whose Death
he had not yet heard of, while <i>Cælestius</i>, trusting to his Eloquence,
and depending on the Favour which the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> had always
shewn to those who recurred to them, undertook a Journey to that
City. He had fled from <i>Carthage</i> to <i>Ephesus</i>, as I have related above.
On his Arrival in that City he was well received by the Bishop of
the Place, and even preferred, after he had staid some time there, to
the Priesthood. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cælestius <i>is driven<br/>from</i> Ephesus <i>and</i><br/>Constantinople.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But, in the mean time, his Doctrine giving Offence
to some, while it was embraced by others, great Disturbances arose;
and he was, in the End, driven out of the City. Being thus expelled
from <i>Ephesus</i>, he repaired to <i>Constantinople</i>; but he no sooner
began to discover his Sentiments there, than <i>Atticus</i>, who then held
that See, and kept a watchful Eye over him, commanded him forthwith
to depart the City<a id='r1496' /><a href='#f1496' class='c015'><sup>[1496]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Repairs to</i> Rome <i>and<br/>presents himself be-<br/>fore</i> Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> From <i>Constantinople</i> he went strait to <i>Rome</i>;
and, finding that <i>Innocent</i> was dead, he presented himself before his
Successor <i>Zosimus</i>, declaring, that he was come to <i>Rome</i>, to defend
his oppressed Innocence at the Tribunal of the Apostolic See;
not doubting but he should make it appear before so knowing and
unprejudiced a Judge, and confute the many groundless Aspersions
with which his Enemies had strove to blast his Reputation in the
Eyes of the whole Church: he complained of the Judgment given
against him by the <i>African</i> Bishops about Six Years before; and,
pretending that his Accuser <i>Paulinus</i>, conscious of his Innocence,
and his own Guilt, had declined the Judgment of the Apostolic See,
he summoned him anew to appear, and make good the Charge which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>he had brought against him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He delivers his Con-<br/>fession of Faith to</i><br/>Zosimus;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> At the same time he presented to <i>Zosimus</i>
a Request, containing a Confession of his Faith, with long Descants
on the Articles of the Apostolic Symbol, concerning which his
Orthodoxy had never been questioned. But as to <i>Grace</i> and <i>Original
Sin</i>, he said, they were not Matter of Faith; but that he was,
nevertheless, ready to acquiesce, even with respect to them, in the
Judgment of the <i>Roman</i> See<a id='r1497' /><a href='#f1497' class='c015'><sup>[1497]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Zosimus</i> had at this Time some Affairs of the greater Importance
on his Hands<a id='r1498' /><a href='#f1498' class='c015'><sup>[1498]</sup></a>; but, highly pleased with the pretended Submission
of <i>Cælestius</i>, and thinking this a favourable Opportunity of extending
his Authority, and drawing to the Tribunal of the Apostolic See Appeals
in Causes that had been judged and decided elsewhere, he postponed
the other Affairs to attend to this alone, in his Opinion, the
most important of all. A Day was appointed, without Loss of Time,
for <i>Cælestius</i> to appear in the Church of St. <i>Clement</i>, and there give
an Account of his Faith. He appeared accordingly; and the Confession
being read, which he had delivered to <i>Zosimus</i>, he owned that,
and no other, to be his Faith. In that Confession he did not deny
Original Sin, but declared, in the clearest Terms, that he was in
Doubt about it; and that the Belief of Original Sin was no Article of
the Catholic Faith. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which is approved<br/>by him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  And yet such a Confession was approved by <i>Zosimus</i>
as Catholic; which was approving, if not the Doctrine, at least
the Doubts which <i>Cælestius</i> entertained of Original Sin<a id='r1499' /><a href='#f1499' class='c015'><sup>[1499]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Roman Catholic<br/><i>Divines strive in vain<br/>to excuse</i> Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The <i>Roman
Catholic</i> Divines have taken great Pains to clear <i>Zosimus</i> from this
Imputation; but have been attended with no better Success than St.
<i>Austin</i> was before them. For that Father, unwilling to condemn
one of his Brethren, pretended that <i>Zosimus</i>, in approving the Confession
of <i>Cælestius</i>, did not declare his Doctrine to be Catholic, but
only the Disposition of his Mind to condemn whatever should be
found amiss in his Doctrine; for such a Disposition, says he, makes a
true Catholic<a id='r1500' /><a href='#f1500' class='c015'><sup>[1500]</sup></a>: he might have added, <i>if sincere, and not feigned</i>;
for it was certainly feigned in <i>Cælestius</i>; and consequently <i>Zosimus</i>
was no less mistaken in declaring his Disposition of Mind to be Catholic,
than if he had made such a Declaration with respect to his
Doctrine. St. <i>Austin</i> himself was sensible of the Weakness of his
Plea, and therefore immediately added; <i>But, allowing the Doctrine
of</i> Pelagius <i>and</i> Cælestius <i>to have been approved by the</i> Roman <i>Church</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span><i>all we can infer from thence is, that the</i> Roman <i>Clergy was guilty
of Prevarication</i><a id='r1501' /><a href='#f1501' class='c015'><sup>[1501]</sup></a>; an Inference which he seems to be no-way solicitous
about, though he could not have admitted it without giving
up the Question, if he had thought the Pope infallible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Haughty Letter<br/>to the</i> African<br/><i>Bishops in favour<br/>of</i> Cælestius.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Zosimus</i>, however prejudiced in favour of <i>Cælestius</i>, did not take
upon him to restore him to the Communion of the Church, from
which he had been cut off by the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> Six Years before,
or to come to any farther Resolution till he had imparted the Affair to
them. He writ accordingly to <i>Aurelius</i> of <i>Carthage</i>, and to the
other <i>African</i> Bishops; not that he stood in need of their Advice, or
wanted to be directed by them, as he let them know in his Letter, but
because he was willing to hear what they had to object against one
who had been first accused at their Tribunal. He upbraids those Prelates,
and with great Bitterness and Acrimony, as if they had acted
with too much Haste and Precipitation in an Affair that required the
most mature Deliberation. As for <i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, the two great
Opposers of <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, he inveighs against them with the
most abusive Language that an implacable Rage could suggest. He lets
the <i>African</i> Bishops know, that if the Accusers of <i>Cælestius</i> did not
appear at <i>Rome</i> in Two Months, to make good their Charge against
him, he would declare him innocent, and admit him as a true Catholic
to his Communion. He styles all such Inquiries, that is, Inquiries
concerning <i>Grace</i> and <i>Original Sin</i>, empty Speculations, and
trifling Disputes, owing to a criminal Curiosity, and an immoderate
Desire of speaking and writing; in which perhaps he was not
much to blame: he closes his Letter with exhorting them not to trust
to their own Judgment, but to adhere in every thing to the Scripture
and Tradition<a id='r1502' /><a href='#f1502' class='c015'><sup>[1502]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Characters of</i><br/>Heros, Lazarus, <i>and</i><br/>Patroclus.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for <i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, against whom <i>Zosimus</i> chiefly vented
his Spleen, while he favoured <i>Cælestius</i>; St. <i>Prosper</i> gives us, in his
Chronicle, the following Account of the former: “<i>Heros</i>, says he,
was Bishop of <i>Arles</i>, a holy Man, and the Disciple of St. <i>Martin</i>.
However, he was driven from his See by his own People, though
quite innocent, and not even accused of any Fault. In his room
was placed one <i><a id='corr336.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Patroculus</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_336.35'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Patroculus</ins></a></span></i>, an intimate Friend of Count <i>Constantius</i>,
who at that Time, bore a great Sway in the Empire, and whose
favour they courted, and hoped to earn by that Violence.” This
happened in 412. All we know of <i>Lazarus</i> is, that he was ordained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Bishop of <i>Aix</i> in <i>Provence</i>, by <i>Proculus</i> Bishop of <i>Marseilles</i>, a
Prelate of extraordinary Merit, as appears from the high Commendations
bestowed on him by the Council of <i>Turin</i><a id='r1503' /><a href='#f1503' class='c015'><sup>[1503]</sup></a>, by St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='r1504' /><a href='#f1504' class='c015'><sup>[1504]</sup></a>,
and by <i>Tiro Prosper</i> in his Chronicle. <i>Patroclus</i>, who was intruded
in the room of <i>Heros</i>, is painted by <i>Tiro Prosper</i>, a Writer no-ways
prejudiced against the <i>Pelagians</i>, or their Friends, as a Man of a most
abandoned Life, and one who turned the Episcopacy into a Trade, and
sold the Priesthood to all who had Money to purchase it<a id='r1505' /><a href='#f1505' class='c015'><sup>[1505]</sup></a>. <i>Baronius</i>
interprets the violent Death, which he suffered in 426. when he was
barbarously murdered by a Military Tribune, as a Punishment from
Heaven for his criminal Intrusion<a id='r1506' /><a href='#f1506' class='c015'><sup>[1506]</sup></a>. Such were the Characters of <i>Heros</i>,
<i>Lazarus</i>, and <i>Patroclus</i>; and yet of the latter, who favoured the
<i>Pelagians</i>, <i>Zosimus</i> entertained the highest Opinion, and often commends
him in his Letters as a Man of great Merit and Virtue. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Heros <i>and</i> Lazarus<br/><i>falsly charged with<br/>many Crimes by</i><br/>Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But
the Two former, who had distinguished themselves above the rest in
opposing the <i>Pelagians</i>, he most outrageously abuses, styling them, in
his Second Letter to the <i>African</i> Bishops, <i>Two Plagues</i>, who, with
their nonsensical Whims, disturbed the Peace and Tranquillity of the
whole Church; <i>Whirlwinds and Storms</i>, that could suffer none to
enjoy any Quiet. He adds, that he was not at all surprised at their
wickedly attempting to defame with false Depositions, and lying Evidences,
a Layman, meaning <i>Pelagius</i>, who had served God so long
with an untainted Reputation, and shining Virtues, since they had
raised so many Storms in the Church, had contrived so many Plots,
employed so many Engines, to compass the Ruin of their Brethren
and Collegues in the Episcopacy<a id='r1507' /><a href='#f1507' class='c015'><sup>[1507]</sup></a>. No Mention is made by the Historians
of those Times of any other Storms or Disturbances in the
Churches of <i>Gaul</i>, but such as were occasioned by the Expulsion of
<i>Heros</i>, and the Intrusion of <i>Patroclus</i>; and these <i>Patroclus</i> probably
exaggerated beyond Measure, laying the whole Blame on <i>Heros</i>. For
<i>Patroclus</i> was in <i>Rome</i> at the very Time <i>Zosimus</i> writ his Letter to the
<i>African</i> Bishops, fraught with Invectives against <i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i><a id='r1508' /><a href='#f1508' class='c015'><sup>[1508]</sup></a>.
In the same Letter <i>Zosimus</i> charges the Two Prelates with several other
Crimes; <i>viz.</i> that they had both been ordained against the <i>Canons</i>,
and against the Will of the People as well as the Clergy, whom, however,
they had forced by Chains, Prisons, Confiscations, and the Favour
of the Tyrant, meaning, no doubt, the Usurper <i>Constantine</i>, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>consent in the End to their Election; that <i>Lazarus</i> had ascended the
Episcopal Throne, while his Hands were still reeking with innocent
Blood, <i>&amp;c.</i> But, had they been guilty of such Excesses, would <i>Prosper</i>,
who lived at this very Time, and all the other Historians, have
passed them over in Silence? Would he have styled <i>Heros</i> an holy
Man? Would St. <i>Austin</i> have called them both his holy Brethren<a id='r1509' /><a href='#f1509' class='c015'><sup>[1509]</sup></a>?
Would the Fathers of the Council of <i>Carthage</i> in 416. have acknowleged
them for their Fellow-Labourers and Collegues in the Priesthood<a id='r1510' /><a href='#f1510' class='c015'><sup>[1510]</sup></a>?
Would <i>Proculus</i> of <i>Marseilles</i>, one of the most illustrious
Prelates at that Time in <i>Gaul</i>, have ordained <i>Lazarus</i>, while his
Hands were still reeking with innocent Blood? We may therefore,
upon the Whole, agree here with <i>Baronius</i><a id='r1511' /><a href='#f1511' class='c015'><sup>[1511]</sup></a>, and ascribe the Crimes,
of which the two Prelates were arraigned by <i>Zosimus</i>, to the Suggestions
of their Enemies, especially of <i>Patroclus</i>, in whom <i>Zosimus</i> reposed
an intire Confidence. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They are both de-<br/>graded and excommunicated<br/>by</i> Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However that be, <i>Zosimus</i>, highly incensed
against both, not only declared them deposed, as Men unworthy
of the Episcopal Dignity, but cut them off from his Communion,
<i>for many Reasons</i>, says he, <i>and, among the rest, because they had deposed
themselves</i><a id='r1512' /><a href='#f1512' class='c015'><sup>[1512]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The injustice of this<br/>Sentence.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>This Sentence he pronounced in their Absence, without even acquainting
them with the Crimes laid to their Charge; not reflecting,
in the Height of his Passion, that he was, at that very Time, complaining
of the <i>African</i> Bishops for having condemned <i>Cælestius</i> in
his Absence, reproaching them with too much Haste and Precipitation,
and laying it down as a Rule never to be swerved from, that
no Man ought to be condemned before he is heard, let the Crimes
laid to his Charge be ever so great. As for their <i>deposing themselves</i>,
or voluntarily abdicating their Dignity, it is very certain, if <i>Prosper</i>
is to be credited, that <i>Heros</i> did not abdicate, but was violently driven
from his See. If <i>Lazarus</i> abdicated (for Cardinal <i>Noris</i><a id='r1513' /><a href='#f1513' class='c015'><sup>[1513]</sup></a> and others<a id='r1514' /><a href='#f1514' class='c015'><sup>[1514]</sup></a>
are of Opinion he did not), that ought not to have been imputed to
him as a Crime, any more than it was to <i>Nazianzen</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>,
and many others, who were not even censured by their
Enemies on that Account. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The other Bishops<br/>make no Account of<br/>the Anathemas of</i><br/>Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The other Bishops seem to have made no

communicate with them, and acknowlege them for their Collegues<a id='r1515' /><a href='#f1515' class='c015'><sup>[1515]</sup></a>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>the Name of <i>Heros</i> was inserted into the Diptychs of the Church of
<i>Arles</i> after his Death; and <i>Lazarus</i> was, according to some, even

<div class='sidenote'>Pelagius <i>transmits<br/>to</i> Zosimus <i>a<br/>Confession of his Faith</i>;</div>

<p class='c001'>Not long after <i>Zosimus</i> had written the Letter, which I have mentioned
above, to the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> in favour of <i>Cælestius</i>, he received
one from <i>Praylius</i> Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, warmly recommending
to him the Cause of <i>Pelagius</i>; and another from <i>Pelagius</i> himself,
in his own Vindication, and with it a Confession of his Faith.
These Letters were directed to <i>Innocent</i>; but he being dead before
they reached <i>Rome</i>, they were delivered to <i>Zosimus</i>. In the Confession
of Faith <i>Pelagius</i> owned, that <i>Baptism ought to be administered
to Children as well as to the Adult</i>; and that, <i>notwithstanding
our Free-will, we want the Assistance of Grace</i><a id='r1517' /><a href='#f1517' class='c015'><sup>[1517]</sup></a>. Neither of these
Propositions was inconsistent with, or repugnant to, his Doctrine;
for though he denied Original Sin, he allowed Baptism to be administred
even to Children, but <i>only for their Sanctification</i>. He admitted
the Necessity of <i>Grace</i>, but not Grace as that Word was understood
by St. <i>Austin</i>, and the other Bishops who opposed him; for
by Grace he meant no more than the Remission of Sins, Instruction,
the Example of Christ. In this Confession he did not disown any of
his Tenets; but, not thinking it safe or adviseable openly to own them,
he industriously declined explaining himself more distinctly on either
of the above-mentioned Heads. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>which he approves of</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Zosimus</i>, however, fully satisfied with
his Confession, and quite astonished (to use his own Words) at the
rash Proceedings of the <i>African</i> Bishops, in condemning, as Heretics,
Men whose Doctrine was so sound and orthodox, immediately transmitted
to <i>Aurelius</i> of <i>Carthage</i>, and his Collegues in <i>Africa</i>, the
Confession as well as the Letter which had been sent him by <i>Pelagius</i>.
On this Occasion he writ himself a second Letter to the <i>African</i>
Bishops, which we may justly style a Panegyric on <i>Pelagius</i> and
<i>Cælestius</i>, and a bitter Invective against their Accusers, <i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and censures the</i><br/>African <i>Bishops for<br/>condemning him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Letter he concludes with exhorting the Bishops of
<i>Africa</i> to the Love of Peace and Unity, and condemning, as guilty
of an Injustice unknown even to the Pagan <i>Romans</i>, those who gave
Judgment in the Absence of the Persons accused, what Crimes soever
were laid to their Charge<a id='r1518' /><a href='#f1518' class='c015'><sup>[1518]</sup></a>, as I have observed above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> African <i>Bishops<br/>maintain their former<br/>Judgment</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The <i>African</i> Bishops were no less surprised to find <i>Zosimus</i> so warmly
engaged in favour of <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, than <i>Zosimus</i> was
surprised at their having condemned them. However, they were determined
to stand to the Judgment which they had given, though sensible
that such a Determination would not fail to produce, if <i>Zosimus</i>
did not yield, a Misunderstanding, and perhaps an intire Separation,
between <i>Rome</i> and <i>Africa</i>. This St. <i>Austin</i> seems chiefly to have
apprehended, and to have been resolved, if it should so happen, to
abdicate and retire<a id='r1519' /><a href='#f1519' class='c015'><sup>[1519]</sup></a>. To prevent this Evil, which would have proved
very detrimental to the common Cause, many Letters passed between
<i>Rome</i> and <i>Africa</i><a id='r1520' /><a href='#f1520' class='c015'><sup>[1520]</sup></a>: but as none of those that were written at this
Juncture by the <i>African</i> Bishops have reached our Times, having been
probably destroyed by those whose Interest it was to destroy them;
all we know concerning this Affair is, that the <i>Africans</i> maintained,
with great Steadiness, their former Judgment against the Pretensions
of <i>Zosimus</i>; and would never allow a Cause, that had been determined
in <i>Africa</i>, to be re-examined at <i>Rome</i>, the rather as <i>Innocent</i>,
the Predecessor of <i>Zosimus</i>, had concurred with them in condemning
both <i>Cælestius</i> and his Doctrine<a id='r1521' /><a href='#f1521' class='c015'><sup>[1521]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Paulinus, <i>summoned to</i><br/>Rome, <i>refuses to<br/>obey the Summons</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Letter from <i>Zosimus</i> to
the <i>African</i> Bishops was carried by one <i>Basilius</i>, Subdeacon of <i>Rome</i>,
who was charged with a verbal Order for the Deacon <i>Paulinus</i>, the
first who accused <i>Cælestius</i>, to repair to <i>Rome</i>. To this Summons
<i>Paulinus</i> returned Answer, that as the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> had condemned
<i>Cælestius</i> upon his Accusation, it was no longer incumbent
upon him, but upon them, to shew that his Accusation was well
grounded; and therefore he could not conceive why <i>Zosimus</i> should
require him to take a Journey to <i>Rome</i><a id='r1522' /><a href='#f1522' class='c015'><sup>[1522]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Council of</i><br/>Carthage <i>condemns<br/>anew the</i> Pelagian<br/><i>Doctrine without<br/>waiting for the Judg-<br/>ment of</i> Zosimus.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the mean time <i>Aurelius</i> of <i>Carthage</i> was under the greatest Apprehension,
lest <i>Zosimus</i> should be prevailed upon by <i>Cælestius</i>, and the
other <i>Pelagians</i> at <i>Rome</i>, to take some hasty Step in their favour.
Having therefore assembled, with all possible Expedition, a Council at
<i>Carthage</i>, he first writ, in his own and their Name, to <i>Zosimus</i>, earnestly
intreating him to suspend all further Proceedings in an Affair of
such Moment, till he was more fully informed. This Letter was written,
and a Messenger dispatched with it to <i>Rome</i>, while the Council
was yet very thin; the Haste <i>Aurelius</i> was in to stop the Proceedings
of <i>Zosimus</i> not allowing him to wait the Arrival of all. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the rest came, and they were in all Two hundred and Fourteen, they
unanimously confirmed their former Sentence, and, without waiting
for the Judgment of <i>Zosimus</i>, condemned anew the Doctrine of <i>Pelagius</i>
and <i>Cælestius</i><a id='r1523' /><a href='#f1523' class='c015'><sup>[1523]</sup></a>. The Decrees which they made on this Occasion
against the <i>Pelagians</i> were received, says <i>Prosper</i>, by <i>Rome</i>, by
the Emperors, no doubt, <i>Honorius</i> and <i>Arcadius</i>, and by the whole
World<a id='r1524' /><a href='#f1524' class='c015'><sup>[1524]</sup></a>. And yet, in the making of these Decrees, the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i> had no Hand; so that it was not <i>Rome</i>, but <i>Africa</i>, it was not
the Pope, but the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, or more truly St. <i>Austin</i> (for
he governed intirely that Council), who taught the Church what she
was to believe, and what disbelieve, concerning <i>Grace</i> and Original
Sin. One of these Decrees is related by <i>Prosper</i><a id='r1525' /><a href='#f1525' class='c015'><sup>[1525]</sup></a>, wherein the Two
hundred and Fourteen Bishops declare, that <i>we are aided by Grace, not
only in the Knowlege, but in the Practice, of Virtue; and that
without it we can neither think, speak, or do any thing whatsoever
that is pious or holy</i><a id='r1526' /><a href='#f1526' class='c015'><sup>[1526]</sup></a>. This, and the other Decrees of the Council,
were sent immediately to <i>Rome</i> by the Fathers, who composed them,
with a Letter for <i>Zosimus</i>, declaring that they were determined to adhere
to the Judgment, which his Predecessor <i>Innocent</i> had formerly
given against <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, till such time as both owned,
and in the most plain and unexceptionable Terms, the Necessity of
Grace, and abjured the opposite Doctrine. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Policy of the</i><br/>African <i>Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It was the Effect of a
refined Policy in the <i>African</i> Bishops not to mention their own Judgment,
but to lay the whole Stress on that of <i>Innocent</i>, though his was
not only preceded, but produced, or rather extorted, by theirs. They
hoped that the Regard, which they pretended to have for <i>Innocent</i>,
would bring <i>Zosimus</i> to a better Temper, and divert him from absolving
those whom his Predecessor had so lately condemned. As
<i>Zosimus</i> had reproached them in his Letter for believing too easily
those who had appeared against <i>Cælestius</i>, they in their turn represented
to him, that he ought not so easily to have believed <i>Cælestius</i>,
and those who spoke in his Favour. In the same Letter they gave him
a particular Account of all that had passed in <i>Africa</i> concerning <i>Cælestius</i>.
No wonder therefore, that <i>Zosimus</i> should have complained
of the Length of the Letter, calling it a Volume, and saying,<a id='r1527' /><a href='#f1527' class='c015'><sup>[1527]</sup></a> that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span><i>he had got through it at last</i>. With this Letter <i>Marcellinus</i>, Subdeacon
of the Church of <i>Carthage</i>, was dispatched to <i>Rome</i>, and
he arrived there in the Beginning of <i>March</i> 418.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Zosimus <i>begins to<br/>yield</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Zosimus</i> was alarmed at the Steadiness of the <i>Africans</i>. He plainly
saw from their Letter, and more plainly from their Decrees, that they
were determined not to yield; and therefore, apprehending the evil
Consequences that would infallibly attend his continuing to protect
<i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i> against them, he resolved to yield, and withdraw,
by Degrees, his Protection from both. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His boasting Letter to<br/>the</i> African <i>Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Hence, in his Answer
to the Council, he contented himself with setting forth and boasting
the Pre-eminence, Authority, and Prerogatives of the Apostolic See;
which however, more modest than his Predecessor, he did not ascribe
to Divine Institution, but to the Canons of the Church, and Prescription.
He tells the <i>African</i> Bishops, that though he is vested with a
Power of judging all Causes, though his Judgment is irreversible, yet
he had chosen to determine nothing without having first consulted
them; and this he dwells upon as an extraordinary Favour. He expresses
great Surprize at their seeming to be persuaded, that he had
given an intire Credit to <i>Cælestius</i>; assures them that he had not been
so hasty, being well apprised that the last and definitive Judgment
ought not to be given but with the greatest Caution, and after the
most mature Deliberation; and in the Close of his Letter lets them
know, that, upon the Receipt of their first Letter, he had suspended
all further Proceedings; and, to gratify them, left Things in the State
they were in before<a id='r1528' /><a href='#f1528' class='c015'><sup>[1528]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Doctrine of</i> Pel-<br/>agius <i>condemned again<br/>in a Council at</i> Carthage.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the mean time the <i>African</i> Bishops, assembling in Council at <i>Carthage</i>,
from all the Provinces of <i>Africa</i>, and some even from <i>Spain</i>,
the more effectually to oppose and defeat any further Attempts of
<i>Zosimus</i>, in favour of <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, condemned their Doctrine
anew, and more distinctly than they had hitherto done. This
Council met on the 1st of <i>May</i> 418. consisted of 225 Bishops, and
enacted Eight Canons, anathematizing the <i>Pelagian</i> Doctrine concerning
Grace and Original Sin<a id='r1529' /><a href='#f1529' class='c015'><sup>[1529]</sup></a>. To these Eight Canons they added
Ten more, calculated to establish some Points of Discipline. Among
the latter the Ninth deserves particular Notice; for it is there decreed,
That Presbyters, Deacons, and inferior Clerks, if they complain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>the Judgment of their own Bishop, may appeal, with his Consent,
to the neighbouring Bishops, and from them to the Primate or Council

Decree <i>Gratian</i> has added, to save the Jurisdiction of the Pope, <i>unless
they appeal to the See of</i> Rome; than which nothing can be
more absurd, since it was to restrain the encroaching Power of the
See of <i>Rome</i> that this Canon was made. We must not forget, that
St. <i>Austin</i> was present at this Council, and signed this, as well as
the other Canons and Decrees, that were, on this Occasion, enacted
by the 225 Bishops.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Law enacted by</i><br/>Honorius <i>against the</i><br/>Pelagians.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <i>Africans</i> had dispatched, the Year before, the Bishop <i>Vindemialis</i>
to the Court of <i>Honorius</i>, with the Decrees of the Council
held against <i>Pelagius</i>, of which I have spoken above. And those
Decrees the Emperor not only approved, but enacted this Year 418.
a severe Law against the <i>Pelagians</i>, dated from <i>Ravenna</i>, the 30th of
<i>April</i>, and addressed to <i>Palladius</i> then <i>Præfectus Prætorio</i>. <i>Honorius</i>
there declares, he had been informed, that <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>
taught, in Opposition to the Authority of the Catholic Church, that
God had created the first Man mortal; that he would have died,
whether he had or had not sinned; that his Sin did not pass to his
Descendents; and several other impious Errors, that disturbed the
Peace and Tranquillity of the Church. To put a Stop therefore to
the growing Evil, he commands <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i> to be driven
from <i>Rome</i>; orders it to be every-where notified, that all Persons
shall be admitted before the Magistrates, as Informers against those
who are suspected of holding their wicked Doctrines; and such as are
found guilty shall be sent into Exile<a id='r1531' /><a href='#f1531' class='c015'><sup>[1531]</sup></a>. In virtue of this Law, an Order
was issued by the <i>Præfecti Prætorio</i>, <i>viz.</i> by <i>Junius Quartus

in the present Dispute; but this is certain, that if <i>Pelagius</i> went too

was infinitely better than theirs, that he declared his own Notions
to be Matters very indifferent to Catholic Faith, and professed
a general Assent to that Faith; whereas they anathematized his Opinions

<div class='sidenote'>Zosimus <i>summons</i><br/>Cælestius <i>to appear<br/>before him, and to<br/>condemn his Doctrine</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i> being thus condemned by the Decrees of
the <i>African</i> Bishops, by the Law of the Emperor, and even by the
Voice of the People, or rather of the Populace, who were everywhere
ready, but no-where more than at <i>Rome</i>, to rise against the
<i>Enemies of Grace</i>, as they were styled, and their Abetters; <i>Zosimus</i>
thought it not safe to afford them any further Protection, unless <i>Cælestius</i>,
who was still at <i>Rome</i> (the Imperial Law not being yet published
there), consented to anathematize the Doctrines ascribed to
him and <i>Pelagius</i>, in such clear and precise Terms as should leave
no room, even for his Enemies, to question his Sincerity. He therefore
appointed a Day for the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, and the neighbouring
Bishops, to assemble; and, acquainting <i>Cælestius</i> with this Resolution,
he summoned him to appear at the Time appointed, that, by condemning
whatever he should be required to condemn, he might be
publicly restored to the Communion of the Church, from which he
had been cut off by the <i>African</i> Bishops. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cælestius <i>instead of<br/>appearing retires<br/>from</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Cælestius</i> was greatly perplexed
with this Summons: he conceived it impossible to dissemble
any longer his real Sentiments; but, at the same time, thinking it
base to renounce them, and foreseeing the Consequences that would
infallibly attend his avowing them, after he had been long in Suspense
what Expedient to resolve on, he concluded at last, that the
best and safest was, privately to withdraw from <i>Rome</i>, and keep himself
concealed till the present Storm was blown over. This Expedient
he chose, and put it in Execution with such Secrecy, that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>was no more heard of till Three Years after, when he appeared again
in <i>Rome</i><a id='r1533' /><a href='#f1533' class='c015'><sup>[1533]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the mean time the appointed Day came; but <i>Cælestius</i> did not
appear: he was summoned a new, and the Proceedings were adjourned
for a few Days; but as he still absented himself, and no Tidings
could be heard of him, <i>Zosimus</i> was so provoked in seeing himself
thus deluded, that, without further Examination, he condemned the
Confession of Faith, which he had approved before; confirmed the
Sentence of the <i>Africans</i>, which he had so sharply censured; and,
anathematizing the Doctrine both of <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, declared
the one and the other cut off from the Communion of the
Church, if they did not publicly renounce and abjure <i>the poisonous
Tenets of their impious and abominable Sect</i><a id='r1534' /><a href='#f1534' class='c015'><sup>[1534]</sup></a>. He did not stop here;
but, to retrieve his Reputation, which had suffered greatly on this
Occasion, and to atone by an opposite Zeal, for that which he had
hitherto exerted in their Favour, he writ a long circular Letter to
all the Bishops, anathematizing the Doctrine of <i>Pelagius</i>, and exhorting
them to follow his Example. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and writes a circular<br/>Letter against them</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Copies of this Letter were sent
into all the Provinces of the Christian World, and out of so great a
Number of Bishops Eighteen only were found, who refused to receive
it, and confirm, with their Subscriptions, the Anathemas it contained<a id='r1535' /><a href='#f1535' class='c015'><sup>[1535]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Some Bishops refuse<br/>to sign it</i>,</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>and send a Confes-<br/>sion of their Faith to</i>-<br/>Zosimus.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for the Eighteen Bishops, who refused to join the rest, they
alleged, that they could not, in Conscience, condemn any Man in
his Absence, and that it was but just they should first hear what
he had to plead in his Defence, quoting to that Purpose the very
Passages of Scripture which <i>Zosimus</i> had quoted in his Letter to
the <i>Africans</i>, censuring them for condemning <i>Pelagius</i> in his Absence.
They added, that, as for <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, they had
both condemned, in their Writings, the Errors imputed to them; and
therefore did not deserve, in their Opinion, the Anathemas that
<i>Rome</i> and <i>Africa</i> had, perhaps too hastily, thundered against them.
<i>Julian</i>, Bishop of <i>Eclana</i> in <i>Campania</i>, one of the Eighteen, and the
most distinguished among them, writ Two Letters on this Subject
to <i>Zosimus</i>, one of which was signed by them all, and contained a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Confession of their Faith, agreeing, in the most material Points, with
the Confessions of <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>. For there they absolutely
reject, and in the strongest Terms, Original Sin, under the Name of
<i>Natural Sin</i>; but allow (and in this Article alone they differ from
<i>Pelagius</i>) that by the Sin of <i>Adam</i> Death was let into the World.
They intreat <i>Zosimus</i> to acquaint them with what should be found
amiss in their Confession; but beg that he would not think of employing
Force, since no Force, but that of Conviction, could produce
in them a Change of Sentiments. They let him know, in the End
of their Letter, that they have already appealed to the Judgment of
an Oecumenical Council<a id='r1536' /><a href='#f1536' class='c015'><sup>[1536]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They are condemned and<br/>degraded by</i> Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Zosimus</i> was so provoked at this Appeal,
that, upon the Receipt of the Letter, he assembled, in great Haste,
a Council, consisting of the <i>Roman</i> Clergy, and the neighbouring
Bishops; and, having caused the Letter to be read in their Presence,
he condemned anew <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, and with them <i>Julian</i>,
and the other Bishops, who signed it, declaring them guilty of the
same Errors, and in Consequence thereof degraded, as incorrigible
Heretics, from the Episcopal Dignity. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They recur to the Emp-<br/>eror for a General Coun-<br/>cil.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Prelates, thus degraded,
had recourse to the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>, complaining of the undeserved
Severity of <i>Zosimus</i>, and intreating him to convene, by his
Authority, an Oecumenical Council, to the Judgment of which they
were ready to submit both themselves and their Doctrine. The Emperor
seemed at first inclined to grant them their Request. But
Count <i>Valerius</i>, a great Friend of St. <i>Austin</i>, and then very powerful
at Court, not only diverted <i>Honorius</i> from it, but prevailed upon
him to enact a Law, banishing from <i>Italy</i> <i>Julian</i>, and with him
all the Bishops, whom <i>Zosimus</i> had deposed<a id='r1537' /><a href='#f1537' class='c015'><sup>[1537]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Who issues several<br/>Laws against them.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This Law was soon
followed by another, commanding all Bishops to sign the Condemnation
of <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>, on Pain of Deposition, and perpetual
Banishment<a id='r1538' /><a href='#f1538' class='c015'><sup>[1538]</sup></a>. The <i>Pelagians</i> interpreted their being refused a Council,
as a Token of Victory; whence <i>Julian</i>, in a Letter which he
writ to his Friends in <i>Rome</i>, insults his Adversaries, as if they had
distrusted their Cause, and therefore declined the Judgment of an
Oecumenical Council<a id='r1539' /><a href='#f1539' class='c015'><sup>[1539]</sup></a>. In another Place he reproaches St. <i>Austin</i>,
in particular, for courting the Friendship of Men in Power, especially
of Count <i>Valerius</i>, with no other View but to crush, by their means,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>those whom he could not convince. St. <i>Austin</i> answered, <i>That
Recourse indeed had been had to Men in Power; but that the</i> Pelagians
<i>ought rather to be thankful, than to complain, on that Score,
since it was not to crush them, or to do them the least Hurt</i> (for they
were only driven from their Sees, and banished for Life), <i>that the
Interest and Power of great Men had been made use of, but merely
to reclaim them from their sacrilegious Temerity</i><a id='r1540' /><a href='#f1540' class='c015'><sup>[1540]</sup></a>. Might not a <i>Decius</i>,
a <i>Dioclesian</i>, or any other Persecutor of the Church, have used
the same Plea to justify his Persecution?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Pelagian <i>Doctrine<br/>condemned by Two<br/>Councils in the East</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>About this time, that is, in the Latter-end of the Year 418. or the
Beginning of 419. the Doctrine of <i>Pelagius</i> was condemned in a
Council held at <i>Antioch</i>, at which presided <i>Theodotius</i> Bishop of that
City; and in another, that met about the Year 421. in <i>Cilicia</i>, under
the famous <i>Theodorus</i> of <i>Mopsuestia</i>, who had been hitherto an
avowed Patron of the <i>Pelagians</i>, had received <i>Julian</i> when driven
out of <i>Italy</i>, and even written a Book against St. <i>Austin</i>, in Defence
of the <i>Pelagian</i> Doctrine<a id='r1541' /><a href='#f1541' class='c015'><sup>[1541]</sup></a>. His Conversion was perhaps owing, as
that of many others certainly was, to the severe Laws enacted against
the <i>Pelagians</i>. Soon after the Council of <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Pelagius</i>, whom
<i>Jerom</i> styles the <i>Second Catiline</i>, was driven from <i>Jerusalem</i>, where
he had lived a long time, and obliged to fly to some other Place for
Shelter<a id='r1542' /><a href='#f1542' class='c015'><sup>[1542]</sup></a>. Whither he retired, or what became of him afterwards, is
not recorded. St. <i>Austin</i> supposes both him and <i>Cælestius</i> to have
been still alive, while he was writing against <i>Julian</i>, that is, about
the Year 421<a id='r1543' /><a href='#f1543' class='c015'><sup>[1543]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pelagius <i>driven from</i><br/>Jerusalem.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>   As for <i>Cælestius</i>, it appears from a Rescript, or rather
a Letter, of the Emperor <i>Constantius</i> to <i>Volusianus</i>, Prefect of
<i>Rome</i>, in 421. that he was then in that City. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cælestius <i>returns to</i><br/>Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For <i>Constantius</i> writes
to <i>Volusianus</i>, that though he had enacted some Laws against the antient
as well as the modern Heresies, yet he was informed, that they
made daily great Progress; and therefore, to prevent the Disturbances
that must arise from thence, he commands the Laws to be put in
Execution, and the Enemies of the true Religion to be carefully
sought for, especially <i>Cælestius</i>, and to be banished, if apprehended,
an Hundred Miles from <i>Rome</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Law issued against<br/>him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  To this Letter the Emperor added,
with his own Hand, by way of Postscript, that the Reputation of <i>Volusianus</i>
depended on the punctual Execution of this Order<a id='r1544' /><a href='#f1544' class='c015'><sup>[1544]</sup></a>. In
Obedience to the Emperor’s Commands, <i>Volusianus</i> issued a Proclamation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>banishing <i>Cælestius</i> an Hundred Miles from <i>Rome</i>, and
threatening with Proscription all who should presume to conceal
him<a id='r1545' /><a href='#f1545' class='c015'><sup>[1545]</sup></a>. <i>Cælestius</i> however appeared again in <i>Rome</i> Three Years after,
and even applied to <i>Cælestine</i>, then in that See, to have his Cause
examined anew. <i>Is banished all</i> Italy. But <i>Cælestine</i>, rejecting his Request with Indignation,
caused him to be banished all <i>Italy</i><a id='r1546' /><a href='#f1546' class='c015'><sup>[1546]</sup></a>. From <i>Rome</i> he repaired
to <i>Constantinople</i>, with <i>Julian</i>, and the other Bishops of the <i>Pelagian</i>
Party, who all met there with a more kind Reception. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Is driven from</i> Constantinople <i>together with</i> Julian, <i>and the other</i> Pelagian <i>Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Emperor
<i>Theodosius</i> the younger was even inclined to assemble, at their
Request, a great Council; and <i>Nestorius</i>, then Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>,
writ to the Pope in their Favour. But, in the mean time,
<i>Marius Mercator</i> having composed, and presented to the Emperor, a
Memorial against them, they were ordered by <i>Theodosius</i>, in virtue
of that Memorial, to depart the City<a id='r1547' /><a href='#f1547' class='c015'><sup>[1547]</sup></a>. Of <i>Cælestius</i> no farther
Mention is made by any of the Antients. As for <i>Julian</i>, he wandered,
for several Years, from Place to Place, being every-where abhorred,
detested, and driven out by the Populace, as if his Presence
had been enough to draw down from Heaven some remarkable Judgment
upon them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Julian <i>dies in</i><br/>Sicily.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, he found an Asylum at last in a small
Village of <i>Sicily</i>, where he earned a Livelihood by keeping a School,
till the Year 455. when he died, after he had divested himself of all
he had, to relieve the Poor of the Place in a great Famine<a id='r1548' /><a href='#f1548' class='c015'><sup>[1548]</sup></a>. He
was a Man of a sprightly Genius, thoroughly acquainted with the
Scriptures, well versed in all the Branches of polite Literature, especially
in the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Poets, and once famous among the
Doctors of the Church<a id='r1549' /><a href='#f1549' class='c015'><sup>[1549]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Birth, Education, &amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He was descended from an illustrious Family.
His Father was an <i>Italian</i> Bishop, for whom St. <i>Austin</i>, notwithstanding
his irreconcileable Aversion to the Son, professed the
greatest Friendship and Veneration<a id='r1550' /><a href='#f1550' class='c015'><sup>[1550]</sup></a>. His Mother was a Lady of the
first Quality, and yet more commendable for her Virtue than her
Birth<a id='r1551' /><a href='#f1551' class='c015'><sup>[1551]</sup></a>. His Enemies, envying him even his noble Descent, strove to
rob him of that Honour, small as it is, in Comparison of his other
Endowments, by giving out, that he was a supposititious Child<a id='r1552' /><a href='#f1552' class='c015'><sup>[1552]</sup></a>. He
was admitted by his Father among the Clergy, when he was yet very
young, and married, when he was of a more mature Age, to a Lady
named <i>Ja</i>, of a Senatorial, nay, of the <i>Æmilian</i> Family, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Daughter of <i>Æmilius</i> Bishop of <i>Benevento</i><a id='r1553' /><a href='#f1553' class='c015'><sup>[1553]</sup></a>. St. <i>Paulinus</i>, Bishop
of <i>Nola</i>, did not think it beneath him to write an Epithalamium on
this Occasion, of a most singular kind; for he advises him and his
Bride to continue Virgins, and observe Continency<a id='r1554' /><a href='#f1554' class='c015'><sup>[1554]</sup></a>. A very extraordinary
Advice on a Wedding-Day! That the married Couple
agreed to it then, we are not told; but, not long after, probably on
the Death of his Wife, <i>Julian</i> bound himself to the Observance of
Continency; for he was ordained Deacon, and soon after raised to
the See of <i>Eclana</i><a id='r1555' /><a href='#f1555' class='c015'><sup>[1555]</sup></a>. He had, long before, embraced the <i>Pelagian</i>
Doctrine; and was so fully convinced of the Truth of it, that he
often declared, if <i>Pelagius</i> himself should renounce his Doctrine, yet
he would not<a id='r1556' /><a href='#f1556' class='c015'><sup>[1556]</sup></a>. These Sentiments he maintained to the last, chusing
rather to be driven from his See, and deprived of all the Comforts of
Life, than to abjure Opinions, which he thought true, or admit Opinions,
which he thought false. He was buried in the Place where he
died; and his Tomb was discovered in the Ninth Century, with the
following Epitaph; <i>Here rests in Peace</i> Julian <i>a Catholic Bishop</i>.
From this Epitaph some have concluded, that he renounced at last
the <i>Pelagian</i> Doctrine, and died a good Catholic. But they were
not, it seems, aware, that the <i>Pelagians</i> constantly styled themselves
Catholics, stigmatizing St. <i>Austin</i>, and the rest who opposed them,
with the Name of <i>Manichees</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Semipelagian<br/><i>Doctrine</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Julian</i> is supposed to have dissented in some Points from <i>Pelagius</i>,
in those especially that relate to Grace, and thereby to have
introduced, or laid down such Principles as naturally tended to introduce,
the <i>Semipelagian</i> Doctrine; which may be reduced to the
following Heads: 1. That when the Truth has been sufficiently declared,
we may, by our own Free-will, without the Help of preventing
Grace, begin to believe it; so that the first Beginning of our
Faith cannot be properly called <i>a Gift of God</i>, but, <i>our own Act</i>.
2. That for all other good Works Grace is necessary (and here they
differed from the <i>Pelagians</i>); but is never denied to a Man, who,
by the good Use of his Free-will, has begun to believe. Thus, according
to them, Grace was the Reward of Faith, and not Faith the
Effect of Grace, which was the Doctrine of St. <i>Austin</i>. 3. That, by
Grace preceding our Merits, no more can be meant, than the natural
Grace and Bounty of God, given to Man in his Reason, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>natural Faculties of his Soul; by the good Use of which, he may
render himself worthy of the extraordinary Grace that is necessary for
him to work out his Salvation. 4. That the Children who die before
they attain to the Years of Discretion, are eternally rewarded or
punished, according to the good or bad Life they would have led,
had they attained to the Years of Discretion. A most impious Tenet!
making God punish Sins with eternal Misery that were never committed:
yet not quite so impious as that of St. <i>Austin</i>; who, without
having recourse to the Supposition of Crimes foreseen, supposed innocent
Children to be eternally damned for a Crime committed by
<i>Adam</i>, if, by the Fault of their Parents, they were not baptized.
Other Tenets of the <i>Semipelagians</i> were these: 5. That the Notion
of Election and Reprobation, independent on our Merits or Demerits,
is maintaining a fatal Necessity, is the Bane of all Virtue, and serves
only to render good Men remiss in working out their Salvation, and
to drive Sinners to Despair. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The System of the</i> Jesuits <i>founded on the</i> Semipelagian <i>Doctrine</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> 6. That the Decrees of Election and Reprobation
are posterior to, and in consequence of our good or evil
Works, as foreseen by God from all Eternity. On these Two last
Propositions the <i>Jesuits</i> found their whole System of <i>Grace</i> and
Free-will, agreeing therein with the <i>Semipelagians</i> against the <i>Jansenists</i>
and St. <i>Austin</i>; though, not daring to contradict <i>the Doctor
of Grace</i>, as he is styled, they pretend their Doctrine, and not that
of the <i>Jansenists</i>, to be the true Doctrine of St. <i>Austin</i>; which has
occasioned endless Disputes, and endless Volumes. The latter Popes
have all favoured the <i>Semipelagians</i> or <i>Jesuits</i> against the <i>Jansenists</i>
and St. <i>Austin</i>; and <i>Clement</i> XI. above all the rest, by his famous Bull
<i>Unigenitus</i>. But the Popes who lived nearer those Times, especially
<i>Gelasius</i> and <i>Hormisda</i>, were all zealous Asserters of the Doctrine
of St. <i>Austin</i>; nay, <i>Hormisda</i> declared the Doctrine contained
in the Books of that Father, namely, in those he writ on
<i>Predestination</i> and <i>Perseverance</i>, to be the Doctrine of the Catholic
Church; which was declaring every true Catholic to be a <i>Predestinarian</i><a id='r1557' /><a href='#f1557' class='c015'><sup>[1557]</sup></a>.
For the Doctrine of Predestination (as Predestination has
been since understood by <i>Calvin</i> and his Followers) is there laid down
in the plainest Terms; which so shocked some Persons, otherwise
eminent for their Piety, say <i>Prosper</i> and <i>Hilarius</i><a id='r1558' /><a href='#f1558' class='c015'><sup>[1558]</sup></a>, that they could
not help censuring it, as a Doctrine repugnant to the Sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>the Church, and the Fathers; nay, as a Doctrine, which, were it
even true, ought not to be made public, since it was not necessary
that Men should know it; and if they did, it would render all Exhortations
to good Works vain and useless<a id='r1559' /><a href='#f1559' class='c015'><sup>[1559]</sup></a>. But these, say the
<i>Jesuits</i>, pretending their System to be the pure Doctrine of St.
<i>Austin</i>, misunderstood that Father, as did <i>Faustus</i> the famous Abbot
of <i>Lerins</i>, when he writ, <i>That if it be true, that some are predestined
to Life, and others to Destruction, as a certain holy Man</i>
(St. <i>Austin</i>) <i>has said, we are not born to be judged, but we are
judged before we are born; so that there can be no Equity in the
Day of Judgment</i><a id='r1560' /><a href='#f1560' class='c015'><sup>[1560]</sup></a>. To speak impartially, it is no easy Matter to
determine what System St. <i>Austin</i> had formed to himself, with respect
to Grace, Free-will, and Predestination: for, in one Place, he
seems to reject and condemn what he had been labouring to prove
and establish in another. Hence <i>Julian</i>, whose Understanding was
far more methodical, used often to quote him against himself, as the
<i>Jesuits</i> and <i>Jansenists</i> still do in maintaining their Systems, though
diametrically opposite, to be intirely agreeable to his Doctrine. He
was apt to run into Extremes, and, in confuting one Error, to lay a
Foundation for many others. Hence even his greatest Admirers are
often at a Loss how to make him agree either with the Church or
himself. However, his great Knowlege in those Days, his extraordinary
Zeal for what he called the Catholic Doctrine, and, above all,
his heaping daily Volumes upon Volumes against all who opposed
it, so dazled the Understandings of the Popes themselves, that, looking
upon him as an inspired Writer, they suffered him to dictate even
to them, as if he had been Pope, and they common Bishops; as if
Infallibility had been transferred from <i>Rome</i> to <i>Hippo</i>, and no longer
vested in them, but in him.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to return to <i>Zosimus</i>: As his Partiality to <i>Pelagius</i> and <i>Cælestius</i>
occasioned a Quarrel between him and the <i>African</i> Bishops; his
Partiality to <i>Patroclus</i>, who had usurped the See of <i>Arles</i>, as I have
related above<a id='r1561' /><a href='#f1561' class='c015'><sup>[1561]</sup></a>, occasioned, in like manner, a Quarrel between him
and some Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>; and from the latter he reaped no more
Credit or Honour, than he had done from the former. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Occasion of this<br/>Quarrel.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  It arose on
the following Occasion: The Bishops of <i>Arles</i> and <i>Vienne</i> had been
long contending for the Metropolitan Dignity, and the Jurisdiction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>attending it, over the Provinces of <i>Narbonne</i> and <i>Vienne</i>: and the
Decision of the Controversy having been referred, some Years before,
to a Council that was held in <i>Turin</i>, it had been there decreed, that
the Bishop who should prove his City to be the Metropolis of those
Provinces, according to the Civil Division of the Empire, should enjoy
the Metropolitan Dignity, and the Privileges annexed to it; but,
in the mean time, to avoid any Breach of Charity, that both should
exercise the Jurisdiction of a Metropolitan over the Churches that were
nearest to their respective Cities<a id='r1562' /><a href='#f1562' class='c015'><sup>[1562]</sup></a>. Thus Matters continued, till <i>Patroclus</i>
repairing to <i>Rome</i>, and there imposing upon <i>Zosimus</i>, who was
quite unacquainted with the Merits of the Cause, prevailed upon him,
by flattering his Vanity and Ambition, to decide, in his Favour, the
Controversy, which had been so long depending. <i>Zosimus</i> censured
very severely, as I have observed above, the <i>African</i> Bishops, for acting,
as he pretended, with too much Haste and Precipitation, in the
Case of <i>Cælestius</i>. But, surely, no Man ever deserved to be more justly
censured, on that score, than himself: for, not to mention the Case
of <i>Heros</i> and <i>Lazarus</i>, whom he excommunicated and deposed in
their Absence, and without hearing what they had to plead in their
Defence, he took upon him to decide the present Controversy, which
a Council had left undetermined, upon the Information given him
by one of the Parties concerned, without hearing the other: for, giving
an intire Credit to all <i>Patroclus</i> said, or could say, in Behalf of
himself and his Church, he writ a Letter, addressed to all the Bishops
of <i>Gaul</i>, declaring, that, for the future, he would receive no
Bishops or Ecclesiastics coming to <i>Rome</i> from those Provinces, unless
they brought with them Letters of Communion, called <i>Formatæ</i>,
from the Metropolitan of <i>Arles</i>, and excommunicating those who
should transgress this Order<a id='r1563' /><a href='#f1563' class='c015'><sup>[1563]</sup></a><a id='rN63' /><a href='#fN63' class='c015'><sup>[N63]</sup></a>. The Privilege of granting the
<i>Formatæ</i> was only personal; for <i>Zosimus</i> did not grant it to the
See of <i>Arles</i>, but to <i>Patroclus</i>, whom he styles his <i>holy Brother, in
Consideration of his extraordinary Merit</i>. To such a Degree had he
suffered himself to be imposed upon, by a Man, who was the Disgrace
of his Order<a id='r1564' /><a href='#f1564' class='c015'><sup>[1564]</sup></a>. In the same Letter he vests him, as Bishop of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span><i>Arles</i>, with a Metropolitan Jurisdiction over the Province of <i>Vienne</i>
and the Two Provinces of <i>Narbonne</i>, adjudges to his See all the
Parishes and Territories that had ever been subject to the City of
<i>Arles</i>, and grants him a full Power to decide and finally determine
all Controversies that should arise in the Three above-mentioned Provinces,
provided they were not of such Consequence as required them
to be examined at <i>Rome</i><a id='r1565' /><a href='#f1565' class='c015'><sup>[1565]</sup></a>. The only Reason <i>Zosimus</i> alleges for
thus exalting the See of <i>Arles</i> to the Prejudice of the See of <i>Vienne</i>,
is, because <i>Trophimus</i>, the First Bishop of <i>Arles</i>, had converted those
Provinces to the Christian Religion. A Reason both false and impertinent:
false, because <i>Trophimus</i> flourished in the Year 250<a id='r1566' /><a href='#f1566' class='c015'><sup>[1566]</sup></a>.
and the Church of <i>Arles</i> was famous as early as the Year 177.
when they writ, with their Brethren of <i>Lions</i>, to the Faithful
in <i>Asia</i><a id='r1567' /><a href='#f1567' class='c015'><sup>[1567]</sup></a>: impertinent, because it was to the Dignity of each
City, and to nothing else, that the Dignity of the Sees was
owing. Hence the Council of <i>Turin</i> wisely adjudged the Metropolitan
Dignity to him who should prove his City to be the civil Metropolis,
with respect to the contested Provinces, as I have observed
above. <i>Zosimus</i>, however, writ a Second Letter, which he addressed
to all the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and <i>Africa</i>, confirming to
the See of <i>Arles</i> all the Rights and Privileges which he had granted
in his First, and rejecting, with Scorn, the Decree of the Council
of <i>Turin</i><a id='r1568' /><a href='#f1568' class='c015'><sup>[1568]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN63'>N63</a>. These Letters were given, in the

<div class='sidenote'><i>He is opposed by<br/>the Bishops of</i> Gaul;</div>

<p class='c001'>The Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, <i>viz.</i> <i>Simplicius</i> of <i>Vienne</i>, <i>Hilarius</i> of <i>Narbonne</i>,
and <i>Proculus</i> of <i>Marseilles</i>, amazed and astonished at the Temerity
of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, openly refused to acknowlege his Authority,
or submit to his Sentence. <i>Zosimus</i>, highly provoked at the
Opposition he met with, writ several threatening Letters to <i>Hilarius</i>
and <i>Proculus</i>, as if he were determined to cut them off from his Communion,
if they did not yield, and acknowlege <i>Patroclus</i> for their
Metropolitan. As for <i>Simplicius</i>, he seems to have acted with less
Vigour on this Occasion than the other Two; and it was perhaps on
that Account that he has been sainted. <i>Hilarius</i> too yielded at last,
not to the Menaces of <i>Zosimus</i>, which he made no Account of, but
to those of Count <i>Constantius</i>, the avowed Patron of <i>Patroclus</i><a id='r1569' /><a href='#f1569' class='c015'><sup>[1569]</sup></a>,
whom he allowed, on that Consideration, to ordain a Bishop at <i>Lodeve</i>,
within the Limits of his Province, which was owning him for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>his Metropolitan. But nothing could shake the Firmness and Constancy
of <i>Proculus</i>. <i>Zosimus</i>, thinking he could frighten him into a
Compliance, began with reproachful Language; from Reproaches he
proceeded to Menaces; and from Menaces, to summon him to <i>Rome</i>,
to answer there for his presuming to ordain Bishops in a Province (the
<i>Second Narbonnese</i>) that had been adjudged by the Apostolic See to
the Metropolitan of <i>Arles</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>especially by</i> Pro-<br/>culus <i>Bishop of</i> Marseilles.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Proculus</i> made so little Account of
his Reproaches, Menaces, and Summons, that I do not even find he
returned them an Answer. It is at least certain, that he did not obey
the Summons, and that he continued to exercise the same Jurisdiction,
which he had exercised before, opposing to the repeated and peremptory
Orders of <i>Zosimus</i> a Canon of the Council of <i>Turin</i>, appointing him
Metropolitan of the <i>Narbonnensis Secunda</i><a id='r1570' /><a href='#f1570' class='c015'><sup>[1570]</sup></a>. <i>Zosimus</i>, transported with
Rage in seeing his Authority thus slighted, writ Three Letters, all
dated the 29th of <i>September</i> 417. <i>viz.</i> one to the People and Clergy
of the Province of <i>Vienne</i>, another to those of the <i>Second Narbonnese</i>,
and the third to <i>Patroclus</i>. In the Two former he inveighs bitterly
against <i>Proculus</i>, and confirms anew to <i>Patroclus</i> the Metropolitan
Dignity and Jurisdiction, which have been so unalterably intailed,
says he, on the See of <i>Arles</i>, by the Decrees of the Fathers and Councils,
that it exceeds even the Power and Authority of the <i>Roman</i>
Church to transfer them to, or intail them upon, any other<a id='r1571' /><a href='#f1571' class='c015'><sup>[1571]</sup></a>. This
was disclaiming, in the plainest Terms, the Power of dispensing with
the Canons, which has since proved so beneficial to the Apostolic See.
And yet <i>Zosimus</i> was acting the whole Time in direct Opposition to the
Fourth Canon of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, vesting, as it was understood by
the subsequent Councils, the Bishop of each Metropolis with the Metropolitan
Dignity and Jurisdiction over the whole Province. <i>Zosimus</i>, in
his Letter to <i>Patroclus</i>, encourages him to resume and exercise, in spite of
<i>Proculus</i>, the Metropolitan Jurisdiction over the <i>Second Narbonnese</i>, which
<i>Proculus</i> had so unjustly invaded and usurped. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Proculus <i>excommunicated and deposed by</i> Zosimus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This <i>Patroclus</i> durst not attempt,
tho’ seconded by the whole Power of the Apostolic See; which
wrought the Pride, Ambition,and Resentment of <i>Zosimus</i> to such a Pitch,
that, giving the Reins to his Passion, he thundered the Sentence of
Excommunication against <i>Proculus</i>, declared him unworthy of, and
degraded from, the Episcopal Dignity, and committing the Church of
<i>Marseilles</i> to the Care of <i>Patroclus</i>, commanded him to exercise there
the Jurisdiction with which he was vetted. The Power of the Apostolic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>See was now exhausted, and, what drove <i>Zosimus</i> almost to Despair,
exhausted to no Effect: for <i>Proculus</i>, to shew how little Regard
he paid to the Sentence pronounced against him at <i>Rome</i>, ordained a
Bishop soon after he was acquainted with it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>But continues to discharge the Functions of his Office.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Zosimus</i>, sensible that
the Authority of his See was here at stake, would not abandon the
Attempt. He writ Two Letters more on the same Subject, one to
<i>Patroclus</i>, exhorting him to exert, with Vigour and Severity, the
Power with which he was vested; and at the same time commanding
him to declare, in his Name, that he should never be prevailed upon
to acknowlege those whom <i>Proculus</i> had ordained. The other Letter
was to the People, Clergy, and Magistrates of <i>Marseilles</i>; stirring
them up against <i>Proculus</i>, and encouraging them to drive him out,
and receive another in his room at the Hands of <i>Patroclus</i>. These
Letters occasioned great Disturbances in the Church of <i>Marseilles</i>,
which was now rent into Two opposite Parties, some refusing to acknowlege
<i>Proculus</i>, and others declaring that they would acknowlege
no other<a id='r1572' /><a href='#f1572' class='c015'><sup>[1572]</sup></a>. But, in spite of the utmost Efforts of <i>Zosimus</i>, of <i>Patroclus</i>,
and their Partisans, <i>Proculus</i> still kept his Ground, still continued
to exercise all Episcopal as well as Metropolitan Functions, as
he had formerly done. He thought even the Evils attending a Schism
of a less dangerous Tendency than those which he apprehended from the
Encroachments of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Steadiness in opposing the Encroachments of</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Had all the Prelates thus stood
up in Defence of their just Rights and Privileges against the Papal
Usurpations, the Church had never been reduced to that deplorable
Thraldom, which she groaned under for so many Ages. But, alas!
there have been in all Times but too many <i>Simplicius’s</i>, who, out of
a mistaken Principle, have chosen rather to yield to an encroaching
Power, than to raise Disturbances, and forego their own Ease, by
withstanding it; but too many <i>Patroclus’s</i>, who, to gratify their own
Ambition, have prostituted their sacred Dignity to the ambitious Views
of the Pope, and raised him, at the Expence of their own Order, that
they might be raised by him in their Turn. <i>Proculus</i>, though deposed,
excommunicated, calumniated, persecuted by <i>Zosimus</i> and his
Tools, kept to the last Possession of his See; nay, and was acknowleged
for lawful Bishop of <i>Marseilles</i>, for Metropolitan of the <i>Second
Narbonnese</i>, not only by the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, but likewise by those
of <i>Africa</i><a id='r1573' /><a href='#f1573' class='c015'><sup>[1573]</sup></a>. He was still alive in 427. when he condemned the Monk
<i>Leporius</i> for maintaining Christ to have been born Man only, but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>have deserved, by his good Works, to become God<a id='r1574' /><a href='#f1574' class='c015'><sup>[1574]</sup></a>. The Encomiums
bestowed on him by the Council of <i>Turin</i>, by St. <i>Jerom</i>, and
<i>Tiro Prosper</i>, as I have observed above, are a sufficient Confutation of
all the Calumnies uttered against him by <i>Zosimus</i>, and the rest of his
Enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last Letters of <i>Zosimus</i>, that is, his Letters to <i>Patroclus</i>, and the

<p class='c001'>The Distemper which he died of lasted a long time, and was attended
with such violent Fits, that he was often thought to be dead
before he died. It was during his Illness that he writ his last Letters;
and yet they are no less remarkable than the rest for that Fire and Vivacity,
that Strength of Expression, and even that Elegance and Purity
of Diction, that were peculiar to him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Character.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  He was a Man of great Address
in the Management of Affairs; well knew how to turn every
thing to his Advantage; and in the several Disputes which he engaged
in, he forgot nothing that could any ways distress those who opposed
him. He was apt to engage too rashly, giving an intire Credit to those
who, by a servile Submission, flattered his Ambition; and when he
had once engaged in a Cause, as he was of a haughty and imperious
Temper, impatient of Controul, passionate, headstrong, full of, and
elated with, the Dignity of the <i>Apostolic See</i>, it required the greatest
Art and Address in his Brethren to bring him into their Measures,
and with-hold him from raising fatal Divisions in the Church. His
whole Conduct and Behaviour towards them, the haughty and peremptory
Style, which he assumed in writing to them, sufficiently shew
that he looked upon them as infinitely below him, as bound to yield
a blind Obedience to all his Commands, and submit, without Reply,
to all his Decisions: and it is not to be doubted but, had he lived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>longer, and not met with the vigorous Opposition which he did from
the Bishop of <i>Marseilles</i>, he would have made great Progress towards reducing
his <i>Fellow-Ministers</i> and <i>Fellow-Labourers</i>, as they are styled
by St. <i>Cyprian</i>, to that State of Dependence, not to say Slavery, which
in the End they have been reduced to by his Successors. He was the
first who made use of the Expression, <i>For so it has pleased the Apostolic
See</i><a id='r1576' /><a href='#f1576' class='c015'><sup>[1576]</sup></a>, an Expression which his Successors have all adopted, as the
Language of the highest Authority, and such as exempted them from
giving any Account either of their Actions, or of the Motives, that
prompted them so to act. But, to paint <i>Zosimus</i> to the Life, we want
no other Colours than those, which the <i>African</i> Bishops, who were
but too well acquainted with him, have furnished us with in the Letter
which they writ to his Successor <i>Boniface</i>. <i>We hope</i>, say they, <i>that
since it has pleased the Almighty to raise you to the Throne of the</i>
Roman <i>Church, we shall no longer feel the Effects of that worldly
Pride and Arrogance, which ought never to have found room in the
Church of Christ</i><a id='r1577' /><a href='#f1577' class='c015'><sup>[1577]</sup></a>. In the same Letter they complain of their having
been made to endure such things as it was almost impossible for them
to endure, which however they were willing to forget. Hard indeed
and tyrannical must the Treatment have been, which they met with
at the Hands of <i>Zosimus</i>, since it could extort from so many venerable
Prelates a Complaint of this Nature, and that in a Letter to his immediate
Successor. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Zosimus <i>sainted by a Mistake of</i> Baronius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Zosimus</i> however has been sainted, and is now worshiped
by the Church of <i>Rome</i> as a great Saint, not so much in regard
of his own Merits, as by a Blunder of <i>Baronius</i> in revising and correcting
the <i>Roman</i> Martyrology. The Case is pretty singular, and may
not be thought quite unworthy of a Place here, by reason of the
Consequences, which every Protestant Reader may draw from it. In
the Martyrology of <i>Bede</i> was marked, <i>St.</i> Zosimus <i>Martyr, who suffered
for the Confession of the Faith</i>. This Martyr an ignorant Transcriber
mistook for the Pope of the same Name, and, concerned to
find so little said of so great a Saint, set down all he knew of him.
This Copy <i>Baronius</i> perused, and, reading there what the Transcriber
had added of his own, concluded the Saint mentioned in that Place
to be Pope <i>Zosimus</i>, and accordingly, upon the supposed Authority
of <i>Bede</i>, allotted him a Place among the other Saints in the <i>Roman</i>
Martyrology. As for his being said to have suffered Martyrdom for
the Confession of the Faith, <i>Baronius</i> ascribed that to the Ignorance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the Transcriber, making but one Saint out of two, though they
lived at so great a Distance of Time from each other; for the Martyr
lived in the earliest Times, and is mentioned by St. <i>Polycarp</i>, who
flourished Two hundred Years and upwards before the Pontificate of
<i>Zosimus</i>. To this double Blunder of the Transcriber and <i>Baronius</i> is
<i>Zosimus</i> indebted for the Worship and Honours that are publicly paid
him in the Church of <i>Rome</i>. Indeed that Church is not more grosly
deluded in paying an idolatrous Worship to Saints, upon the Authority
of her <i>Infallible Guide</i>, than in the Objects to whom that Worship
is paid<a id='rN65' /><a href='#fN65' class='c015'><sup>[N65]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN65'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN65'>N65</a>. <i>Bollandus</i>, to saint <i>Zosimus</i> in a more
honourable Way, supposes him to have
once had a Place in the Martyrology of St.
<i>Jerom</i>; and complains of those who have
taken the Liberty to strike out his Name.
One would think he had found his Name
in some Copy of that Martyrology, or at
least heard of it; but he ingenuously owns,
that he never found it there himself, nor
heard of any who did; adding, that nevertheless
he is fully persuaded it was once
there, and that he cannot think otherwise;
and it is upon his <i>not being able to think
otherwise</i> that he founds his Supposition, his
Complaints, and the Saintship of <i>Zosimus</i><a id='rN65.1' /><a href='#fN65.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>;

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c009'><i>Zosimus</i> being dead, great Disturbances arose about the Election
of his Successor. <i>Eulalius</i>, whom Authors distinguish with
the Title of Archdeacon, shutting himself up in the <i>Lateran</i> with Part
of the People, and some Presbyters and Deacons, was there chosen by
them in the room of <i>Zosimus</i>. At the same time a great Number
of the People, many Presbyters, and some Bishops, assembling in the
Church of St. <i>Theodora</i>, named the Presbyter <i>Boniface</i> to the vacant
See. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Boniface <i>and</i> Eulalius <i>both chosen</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Both were ordained the same Day they were chosen; <i>Boniface</i>,
by Nine Bishops, and in the Presence of Seventy Presbyters; <i>Eulalius</i>,
by Three Bishops only, and in the Presence of a very small Number of
Presbyters; but the Bishop of <i>Ostia</i> was one of the Three; and he
claimed, from a Custom which had long obtained, the Right of ordaining
the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Governor of</i> Rome <i>and the Emperor favour</i> Eulalius,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Symmachus</i>, Governor of the City, did all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>that lay in his Power to prevent this double Election; but, not succeeding
therein, he immediately dispatched an Express to the Emperor
<i>Honorius</i>, then at <i>Ravenna</i>, with a Letter dated the 29th of <i>December</i>
418. acquainting him with what had passed. But his Account
was not impartial: he represented <i>Eulalius</i> as lawfully chosen, and
his Competitor as an Usurper. <i>Honorius</i> therefore, by a Rescript dated
the 2d of <i>January</i> 419. ordered him to persuade <i>Boniface</i> to retire
from <i>Rome</i>, to use Force, if Persuasions did not prevail, and to apprehend
and punish the Ringleaders of the Sedition, if any should be
raised on that Occasion. With this Rescript the Emperor dispatched
<i>Aphrodisius</i> a Tribune and Notary; and <i>Symmachus</i>, having received
it on the 6th of <i>January</i>, sent early next Morning his Primiscrinius,
or first Secretary, with an Order for <i>Boniface</i> to attend him, and hear
what he had to impart to him in the Emperor’s Name, letting him
know, in the mean time, that he must not take upon him to exercise
any Episcopal Functions; for such was the Will and Pleasure of the
Emperor. This Order <i>Boniface</i> received while he was holding an
Assembly in the Church of St. <i>Paul</i> without the Walls; but paid no
Regard to it; nay, those who attended him, falling on the Secretary,
who brought it, treated him very roughly; which <i>Symmachus</i> no
sooner knew than he caused the Gates of the City to be shut, and
kept <i>Boniface</i> out. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who takes Possession of the Church of St.</i> Peter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In the mean time <i>Eulalius</i>, improving to his
Advantage the Absence of his Competitor, repaired to the Church of
St. <i>Peter</i>, took Possession of it amidst the loud Acclamations of his
Partisans, and exercised there all Episcopal Functions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Friends of</i><br/>Boniface <i>write to<br/>the Emperor</i>,</div>

<p class='c001'>The avowed Partiality of <i>Symmachus</i> for <i>Eulalius</i> left no room to
doubt but he had misinformed the Emperor. The Bishops therefore,
with the Presbyters and People, who had chosen <i>Boniface</i>, thought
it their Duty to transmit to him a candid and impartial Account of
the late Transactions: and this they did accordingly, intreating the
Emperor at the same time to revoke his former Order, and to summon
both <i>Eulalius</i> and <i>Boniface</i> to Court, in order to try their Cause
there. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>who summons a Council to decide the Controversy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Their Request appeared just; and <i>Honorius</i>, in Compliance
with it, sent an Order to <i>Symmachus</i>, dated the 13th of <i>January</i> 419.
commanding him to suspend the Execution of his former Order, and
to notify to the Two Competitors, that they, and those who ordained
them, must repair to <i>Ravenna</i>, on Pain to him who should fail to
appear there on the 8th of the ensuing <i>February</i>, of having his Election
declared null. Several Bishops were summoned to attend at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>time, <i>Honorius</i> thinking it proper, that a Dispute of that Nature
should be decided by none but Bishops. However, to remove all Suspicion
of Partiality on his Side, he would not allow those to sit as
Judges, who had been any-ways concerned in the Election or Ordination
of either of the Competitors. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A more full Council summoned.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Bishops met; but not being
able to agree among themselves, <i>Honorius</i> thought the Affair of such
Importance, that he put it off to the 13th of <i>June</i>, with a Design to
have it decided then in a full Council. He writ accordingly not only
to the Bishops of <i>Italy</i>, but to those too of <i>Gaul</i> and <i>Africa</i>, inviting
them to the Council, and acquainting them with the Time and Place
of its meeting. In the mean while he strictly injoined both <i>Boniface</i>
and <i>Eulalius</i> to keep at a Distance from the City, lest their Presence
should occasion Disturbances there. But as <i>Easter</i> approached,
he appointed <i>Achilleus</i> Bishop of <i>Spoleti</i>, who was of neither Party,
to perform the Episcopal Functions at <i>Rome</i> during that Solemnity.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Eulalius <i>disobeys the Emperor, and is driven from</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This <i>Eulalius</i> could not brook; and therefore returning to <i>Rome</i>, in
open Defiance of the Emperor’s Orders, he assembled the People, seized
on the <i>Lateran</i>, and shutting the Doors against <i>Achilleus</i>, performed
in that Basilic the Episcopal Functions usual at <i>Easter</i>. The
Emperor, being acquainted by <i>Symmachus</i> with what had passed,
was so provoked at his Disobedience and Temerity, that, by a Rescript
dated from <i>Ravenna</i> the 3d of <i>April</i>, and received at <i>Rome</i> on
the 8th of the same Month, he commanded <i>Symmachus</i> to drive <i>Eulalius</i>
from the City, and to put <i>Boniface</i> in Possession of the disputed
See; which was accordingly done<a id='rN66' /><a href='#fN66' class='c015'><sup>[N66]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus was an End put to the Schism; thus was <i>Boniface</i> placed on
the <i>Roman</i> See, and vested with the Papal Dignity by the <i>Clemency of
the Emperor</i>, as <i>Largus</i> Proconsul of <i>Africa</i> expresses it in his Letter
to the Bishops of that Province<a id='r1578' /><a href='#f1578' class='c015'><sup>[1578]</sup></a>; and not by the Authority of a

His first Care, after he found himself in the quiet Possession of his See,
was to prevent for the future, so far as in him lay, the Cabals and Intrigues
that might be formed at other Elections, as they had been at
his, to the great Disturbance of the City, and Scandal of the Christian
Religion. With this View he writ to the Emperor, intreating him
to restrain, by some severe Law, the Ambition of those who, trusting
more to their Intrigues than their Merit, aspired to a Dignity that was
due to Merit alone<a id='rN67' /><a href='#fN67' class='c015'><sup>[N67]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Law for that<br/>Purpose.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, in Compliance with so just a Demand, enacted a
Law, well calculated to prevent effectually the Evil complained of,
and keep the Ambition of the Candidates to the Papacy within due
Bounds. For by this Law, when Two Persons were chosen, neither
was to hold the Dignity, but the People and Clergy were to proceed
to a new Election. This is the first Instance, that occurs in History,
of Princes intermeddling in the Election of the Pope; an Evil, says
F. <i>Pagi</i>, which, from small Beginnings, grew to such a Height as to
reflect great Shame and Disgrace on the <i>Roman</i> Church.<a id='r1582' /><a href='#f1582' class='c015'><sup>[1582]</sup></a> But it
must be observed, that the original Evil was the Corruption, the Violence,
and the many Disorders which the Clergy and People were
guilty of in those Elections. It was this which, at the Request of the
Pope himself, called on the Emperors to interpose their Authority, as
the only adequate Remedy to such Abuses. The succeeding Emperors
followed the Example of <i>Honorius</i>, and the <i>Gothic</i> as well as the
<i>Lombard</i> Kings, the Example of the Emperors, as we shall see in the
Sequel of the present History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Boniface <i>free from<br/>Ambition</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Boniface</i> was naturally a Lover of Peace, and an Enemy to all
Strife and Contention. He did not claim, nor attempt to usurp, any
new Power over his Collegues; but yet he would not part with any
his Predecessors enjoyed, by what means soever they had acquired it;
and those who attempted to curtail the usurped Jurisdiction of the
Apostolic See, met with as vigorous an Opposition from him as they
could have done either from <i>Innocent</i> or <i>Zosimus</i>. In short, he had
not Ambition enough to inlarge his Authority, but thought himself
in Conscience obliged <i>to maintain the just Rights</i>, as he styled and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>believed them, <i>of the See in which it had pleased Divine Providence
to place him, though unworthy of so great an Honour</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dispute between him and the Bishops of</i> Illyricum.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  His Steadiness
in asserting these Claims appeared chiefly in the Dispute that
arose between him and the Bishops of <i>Illyricum</i>, over whom <i>Damasus</i>
had usurped, as I have related elsewhere<a id='r1583' /><a href='#f1583' class='c015'><sup>[1583]</sup></a>, and his Successors
maintained a particular Power and Jurisdiction. The Transaction is
thus related by the Writers of those Times. The See of <i>Patræ</i> in
<i>Achaia</i>, one of the Provinces of <i>Illyricum</i>, being vacant, the Bishop
of <i>Corinth</i>, Metropolitan of that Province, did all that lay in his
Power to get <i>Perigenes</i>, a Presbyter of an unexceptionable Character,
chosen in the room of their deceased Bishop. But his Endeavours
proving unsuccessful, he returned to <i>Corinth</i>, and died soon after.
Upon his Death the People and Clergy of <i>Corinth</i>, to honour his Memory,
and shew the Regard they had for one whom he had favoured,
unanimously named <i>Perigenes</i> to succeed him. But as they apprehended
some Opposition from the Bishops of the same Province, they
writ to <i>Boniface</i>, begging him to confirm their Election with his
Authority. <i>Boniface</i> referred them to <i>Rufus</i>, then Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i>,
and his Vicar in those Parts, declaring that, as for himself,
he had nothing to object either against their Election, or the Person
elected. <i>Rufus</i> notified to the Bishops of the Province, and the Metropolitans
of the Diocese, the Approbation of <i>Boniface</i>, and his own;
but it was not received by all in the same manner. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Law of</i> Theodosius <i>concerning Disputes that should arise in</i> Illyricum.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The greater Part
indeed agreed to the Ordination of the new Bishop; but some opposed
it with great Warmth, prompted, most probably, by the Jealousy
they entertained of the growing Power of the See of <i>Rome</i>:
for, at their Request, a Law was published by the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>,
dated the 14th of <i>July</i> 421. commanding all Disputes, that should
arise in the Diocese of <i>Illyricum</i>, to be finally determined by the Bishops
of that Diocese, after they had consulted the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i><a id='r1584' /><a href='#f1584' class='c015'><sup>[1584]</sup></a>.
This was taking those Provinces from the Bishop of
<i>Rome</i>, and, in some Degree, subjecting them to the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>,
or at least opening a Door for such a Subjection. The
Power of the Bishops of <i>Constantinople</i> was already grown very considerable,
and their Ambition keeping Pace with that of the Bishops
of <i>Rome</i>, neither let any Opportunity slip of extending the Jurisdiction
of their own See at the Expence of the other. In the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Case the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, availing himself of the Favour of
the Emperor, and the Disagreement that reigned among the <i>Illyrican</i>
Bishops, summoned, without Loss of Time, a Council to meet at
<i>Corinth</i>, and there to examine the Ordination of <i>Perigenes</i>, though
he had been ordained, and his Ordination approved of both by <i>Rufus</i>
and <i>Boniface</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Three Letters of</i> Boniface.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  This Step, quite unexpected, alarmed <i>Boniface</i>;
he divested himself at once of his pacific Disposition, and, assuming
the Air and Style of Authority, he writ Three Letters, all dated
the same Day, <i>viz.</i> 11th of <i>March</i> 422. encouraging the Friends of
the Apostolic See to maintain its Rights, and threatening those who
dared to invade them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He maintains, with Authority, his pretended Rights.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The first was to <i>Rufus</i> of <i>Thessalonica</i>, whom
he animates not to suffer any Innovations, but vigorously to withstand
those, who assumed an Authority that did not become them, and to
which they had no kind of Title or Claim, meaning, no doubt, the
Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>. The Second Letter he writ to the Bishops
of <i>Thessaly</i>, exhorting them to acknowlege the Authority of <i>Rufus</i>,
and no other. The Third was addressed to the Bishops of <i>Macedon</i>,
<i>Achaia</i>, <i>Thessaly</i>, <i>Epirus</i>, and <i>Dacia</i>, who had been summoned
by the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i> to assemble at <i>Corinth</i>, and there deliver
their Opinion concerning the Ordination of <i>Perigenes</i>. In this
Letter he complains, in the strongest Terms, of so bold and daring
an Attempt, asking, in the Style of a Sovereign, <i>What Bishop shall
presume to question an Ordination approved by us? What Bishop
could take upon him to assemble a Council with that View and Intent?
Read</i>, he adds, <i>read the Canons, and there you will find, that
the See of</i> Rome <i>is the First, the See of</i> Alexandria <i>the Second, and
that of</i> Antioch <i>the Third. These are the Three great Sees; these
the Sees which the Fathers have distinguished above the rest, with
ample Privileges, and extensive Jurisdiction.</i> Since he refers them
to the Canons to shew, that these Three Sees are superior to the See
of <i>Constantinople</i>, both in Dignity and Jurisdiction, it were to be
wished he had, at the same time, acquainted them by what Canons
his Predecessors had exercised over the Provinces of <i>Illyricum</i> the
Jurisdiction which he now so zealously asserts. But that is more
than it was in his Power to do. However, in the present Letter, he
threatens with Excommunication such of the <i>Illyrican</i> Bishops as shall,
in Defiance of his Orders, comply with the Summons which they
have received, or presume to question the Ordination of <i>Perigenes</i>.
What was the Issue of this Dispute is not recorded by any of the Antients;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>but a modern Historian<a id='r1585' /><a href='#f1585' class='c015'><sup>[1585]</sup></a> informs us, that the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>
interposing, at the Request of <i>Boniface</i>, in Behalf of the See of
<i>Rome</i>, prevailed upon <i>Theodosius</i> to revoke his former Law, and enact
another in its room, confirming to the Apostolic See all its antient
Privileges, and injoining the <i>Præfectus Prætorio</i> to see the
latter Law put in Execution. The Historian quotes this Law from the
Archives of the <i>Roman</i> Church. But as it is not to be found either
in the <i>Theodosian</i> or the <i>Justinian</i> Code, its Authenticity may be justly
suspected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He revokes the Priv-<br/>ileges granted by</i><br/>Zosimus <i>to the<br/>Church of</i> Arles.</div>

<p class='c001'>The same Year 422. <i>Boniface</i> gave a signal Instance of his Equity
and Love of Justice, which redounds greatly to his Honour, and therefore
ought not to be omitted. He was sensible, that his Predecessor
<i>Zosimus</i>, abusing his Authority, had acted in the Affair of the <i>Gallican</i>
Bishops, in a most partial and arbitrary manner; that the See of
<i>Arles</i> had no just Title to the many Privileges, which he had been
induced, by his Partiality for <i>Patroclus</i>, to heap on it, at the Expence
of Two other Sees; and, consequently, that it was incumbent upon
himself, now that he had the Power in his Hands, to rectify by a
better Use of it, what his Predecessor had done amiss. The Love of
Justice therefore prevailing in him over all other Considerations, he
annulled, by a Letter addressed to <i>Hilarius</i> of <i>Narbonne</i>, whatever
had been done by <i>Zosimus</i> in favour of the See of <i>Arles</i>, restored
and confirmed to the Sees of <i>Narbonne</i> and <i>Vienne</i> all the Rights
and Privileges, which they had been so unjustly divested of, and declaring
all the Grants and Concessions made to the See of <i>Arles</i> repugnant
to the Canons, strictly injoined the Bishop of <i>Narbonne</i> not to suffer
his Brother of <i>Arles</i> to exercise, in virtue of them, any kind of Authority
within the Limits of his Jurisdiction<a id='rN68' /><a href='#fN68' class='c015'><sup>[N68]</sup></a>. The Conduct of
<i>Boniface</i> was afterwards approved, and that of <i>Zosimus</i> justly condemned,
by Pope <i>Leo the Great</i>, declaring in a Letter which he writ
to the Bishops of the Province of <i>Vienne</i>, that the Privileges, which
the Apostolic See had granted to <i>Patroclus</i>, were afterwards revoked
<i>by a more equitable Sentence</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A remarkable Instance<br/>of his Moderation.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>One of the many Artifices, employed by the Popes to aggrandize
their See, was to raise Divisions among their Collegues, or to foment
underhand those that others had raised. For in such Divisions they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>never stood neuter, but, taking Part in the Quarrel, nay, and making
themselves Principals, they warmly declared in favour of one Party
against the other, that, by supporting them, they might be in their
Turn supported by them in all their Pretensions. To this worldly
Wisdom, this wicked Policy, <i>Boniface</i> was an utter Stranger: for he
did not lay hold of a very favourable Opportunity, which the Division,
that reigned at this time among the Bishops of <i>Gaul</i>, offered
him, to improve his Authority, and extend his Jurisdiction. The
Metropolitan Dignity was disputed there by the Bishops of <i>Vienne</i>, of
<i>Narbonne</i>, and of <i>Arles</i>, as I have observed above. During that
Contest the Clergy of <i>Valence</i>, quarreling with their Bishop <i>Maximus</i>,
charged him with several Crimes; but not caring to accuse him
at the Tribunal of any of the Three Competitors (for that had been
acknowleging, in one of the Three, the Metropolitan Jurisdiction
then in Dispute), they arraigned him at <i>Rome</i>, and summoned him
to plead his Cause there before <i>Boniface</i>. Most other Popes would
have eagerly embraced such an Opportunity of inlarging their Power;
nay, and founded upon this particular Case the general Right of
judging, and finally determining, all Causes of the like Nature. But
<i>Boniface</i> declared, in his Letter to <i>Patroclus</i>, and the other Bishops
of the Seven Provinces of <i>Gaul</i>, that though <i>Maximus</i> had been accused
at his Tribunal, though he had not appeared to clear himself
from the Crimes laid to his Charge, and might thereupon be thought
guilty, and be justly condemned; yet he would not take upon him to
pronounce such a Sentence, because that Bishop <i>ought, according to
the Canons, to be judged and condemned, or absolved, in his own
Province</i>. An Instance of Moderation that reflects no small Honour
on the Memory of <i>Boniface</i>; the rather as he had before his Eyes the
recent Examples of <i>Innocent</i> and <i>Zosimus</i>, the Two most ambitious
and arrogant Popes the Church had yet seen. He closes his Letter
with exhorting the Bishops of the Seven Provinces to assemble against
the First of <i>November</i>, that <i>Maximus</i> may be cleared, if innocent,
or condemned, if guilty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>His Death.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><i>Boniface</i> died on the 4th of <i>November</i> 422. having held the Chair
3 Years, 9 Months, and some Days. He was buried in the C&oelig;metery
of the Martyr St. <i>Felicitas</i>, on the <i>Salarian</i> Way; where he is said
to have built an Oratory. He is worshiped by the Church of <i>Rome</i>
among her Saints, an Honour which few of his Predecessors better
deserved. But it is a Wonder that the last Instance I have given of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>his Moderation, and Regard to the Canons against the Claims of his
See, did not exclude him out of the Calendar. His Festival is kept
on the 25th of <i>October</i>; and <i>Bede</i> quotes a Book of Miracles wrought
by Pope <i>Boniface</i><a id='r1586' /><a href='#f1586' class='c015'><sup>[1586]</sup></a>; but whether by the First Pope of that Name, or
the Second, he does not inform us, though he seems to give an intire
Credit to every idle Tale that Legend contained. And here I cannot
help observing, by the way, that the less necessary Miracles became,
the more they were multiplied. In <i>Bede</i>’s Time, and the Three preceding
Centuries, Men were rather inclined to believe too much than
too little; and yet in no other Time was there a greater Profusion of
Miracles. From an antient Epitaph quoted by <i>Baronius</i><a id='r1587' /><a href='#f1587' class='c015'><sup>[1587]</sup></a>, it appears
that <i>Boniface</i> died very old; that he had served the Church from his
tender Years; that by his engaging Behaviour he put an End to the
Schism, and that he relieved <i>Rome</i> in the time of a Famine.</p>

indeed, who was still alive, and led a retired Life in the neighbouring

Fortune a Second time; but he did not chuse to quit his Solitude,
and involve both himself and them in new Troubles. <i>Celestine</i> was
a Native of <i>Rome</i>, the Son of one <i>Priscus</i>, and a Deacon, if not a

<div class='sidenote'>Antony, <i>one of St.</i><br/>Austin’s <i>Disciples,<br/>appointed by his<br/>Interest Bishop of</i><br/>Fussala.</div>

<p class='c001'>He was scarce warm in the Chair, when he received a Letter from
St. <i>Austin</i> on the following Occasion. As the small Town, or rather
Village of <i>Fussala</i>, belonging to the Bishoprick of <i>Hippo</i>, the See of
St. <i>Austin</i>, stood at a great Distance from that City, the good Bishop
thought he could not better consult the spiritual Welfare of the Inhabitants,
who had but very lately abandoned the Party of the <i>Donatists</i>,
than by causing their Town to be erected into a separate Bishoprick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>and letting them have a Bishop of their own. This was indeed
abridging both his own Jurisdiction and Revenues; but as he had the
Good of the People more at Heart than either, he pursued his Scheme
with Success, and prevailed upon his Collegues in <i>Numidia</i> to ordain
a young Man named <i>Antony</i>, whom he had brought up from his Infancy,
the first Bishop of the Place, though at that time only a Reader.
This Promotion, <i>per saltum</i>, as it is styled, was strictly forbidden by
the Popes in their Decretals; but to their Orders St. <i>Austin</i> paid no
greater Regard than the other Bishops did, though he always spoke of
them, and to them, with all the Respect that was due to the first Bishop
in the West.<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Antony<i>’s scandalous Behaviour</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>   St. <i>Austin</i> had soon Occasion to repent his transgressing
those Regulations, which, it must be owned, are in themselves very
wise: for <i>Antony</i>, who was but a Youth, and had been kept by St.
<i>Austin</i> under great Restraint, no sooner found himself free from all
Controul, than abandoning himself intirely to the Indulgence of his
youthful Passions, he thereby scandalized the new Catholics to such a
Degree, that they let St. <i>Austin</i> know the Conduct of their Bishop,
unless he was quickly removed, would certainly drive them to the last
Extremity; meaning, perhaps, that they should be forced either to put
him to Death, or to join anew the <i>Donatists</i>, whom they had but
lately forsaken. Such Menaces alarmed St. <i>Austin</i> no less than the
Conduct of his favourite Disciple surprised him. A Council was immediately
summoned at his Request by the Primate of <i>Numidia</i>; <i>Antony</i>
was ordered to attend it, and the Inhabitants of <i>Fussala</i> invited to
lay their Complaints before the Assembly. The Summons was complied
with by all, and <i>Antony</i>, by a great Number of Witnesses, convicted
of Rapine, Violence, and Extortion. But, because some capital
Crimes laid to his Charge were not sufficiently proved, the Fathers
of the Council, out of an unseasonable Compassion, contented themselves
with only condemning him to restore to the Inhabitants of <i>Fussala</i>
what he had with Violence taken from them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is deprived of the Administration, and all Jurisdiction, by a Council.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They were even
inclined to leave him in the quiet Possession of his Church; but that
being warmly opposed by the People, they deprived him of the Administration,
and of all Jurisdiction; but as he still retained the Episcopal
Dignity, they did not chuse to remove him to another City to
live there even as a private Person, lest they should be thought to transgress
the Rules of the Fathers forbidding Translations<a id='r1589' /><a href='#f1589' class='c015'><sup>[1589]</sup></a>. None could
think so who were the least acquainted with those Rules.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He appeals to</i> Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span><i>Antony</i> satisfied, pursuant to his Sentence, the Inhabitants of <i>Fussala</i>,
whom he had wronged. But pretending that he had been unjustly
deprived of his Bishoprick, he resolved to appeal to <i>Rome</i>. He
was sensible that his appealing at this Juncture, when the Point of Appeals
was warmly disputed, as I shall relate hereafter, was Merit enough
to recommend him to the Favour of that See. However, not trusting
to that alone, as <i>Boniface</i> was still alive, he first engaged in his Favour
his own Primate, the Primate of <i>Numidia</i>, who, having been excused
on account of his great Age from assisting at the Council, was not
well acquainted with what had passed there. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Prevails upon the Primate to write in his Behalf to</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Him therefore he easily
persuaded, that he had been very ill used by the Council: <i>For had
they thought me guilty</i>, said he, <i>of the Rapine and Extortions, that
were laid to my Charge, they ought, and, without all doubt, would
have deposed me: they have not deposed me; and therefore did not, as
is manifest, think me guilty. If I did not deserve to be degraded
from my Dignity, I did not deserve to be driven from my See.</i> Thus
he artfully turned the Mercy that had been shewn him against those
who had shewn it; and, having by that means imposed upon the Primate,
persuaded him to write a Letter in his Behalf to <i>Boniface</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How received by</i> Boniface.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With
this Letter he repaired to <i>Rome</i>, but did not meet there with the Reception
he expected: for all he could obtain of <i>Boniface</i> was a Letter
to the Bishops of <i>Numidia</i>, requiring them to reinstate him in his See,
<i>provided he had represented Matters as they truly were</i>. This conditional
Request <i>Antony</i>, on his Return to <i>Africa</i>, improved, it seems,
into an absolute Command: for he threatened the People of <i>Fussala</i>
with a Visit from the Imperial Troops and Commissaries, if they did
not receive him as their lawful Bishop, in Compliance with the Orders
of the Apostolic See<a id='r1590' /><a href='#f1590' class='c015'><sup>[1590]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The People of</i> Fussala <i>write against him to</i> Celestine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  In the mean time <i>Boniface</i> dying, and <i>Celestine</i>
being chosen in his room, the People of <i>Fussala</i> apprehending,
as St. <i>Austin</i> writes, greater Evils from a Catholic Bishop, after their
Return to the Church, than they had done from a Catholic Emperor
during their Separation, writ a most pathetic Letter to the new Pope,
intreating him to pity their Condition, to curb <i>Antony</i> in his unchristian
Attempts, and to redeem them, by his Authority, from the Calamities
which they had Reason to apprehend from that Prelate’s Cruelty
and Ambition. In the same Letter they imputed all their Misfortunes
to <i>Austin</i>, who had set over them such a Bishop. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Are seconded by St.</i> Austin.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  And this <i>Austin</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>was so far from taking amiss, that he owned the Charge, and even
backed their Request with a Letter of his own, conjuring <i>Celestine</i>,
by the Memory of St. <i>Peter</i>, <i>who abhorred all Violence and Tyranny</i>,
not to use either with the People of <i>Fussala</i>, who, he said, had but
too much Reason not to submit tamely to the galling Yoke from
which they had been so lately delivered. He adds, that if, in spite
of all his Endeavours and Remonstrances, he should still have the
Mortification to see the Church of <i>Fussala</i> plundered and tyrannically
oppressed by one whom he had raised to that See, he should think
himself obliged to atone for the Share which he had in his Crimes,
by resigning his own<a id='r1591' /><a href='#f1591' class='c015'><sup>[1591]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Celestine <i>acquiesces in the Sentence of the Council of</i> Numidia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Celestine</i> was so affected with these Letters,
that he immediately acquiesced in the Sentence of the Council of
<i>Numidia</i>; and the new Bishoprick of <i>Fussala</i> being suppressed, that
Town, with its District, was again subjected to the See of <i>Hippo</i>.
From these Letters, that were written by the <i>Africans</i> on this Occasion,
it appears, that the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> used, in those Days, to
send some of their Ecclesiastics into <i>Africa</i>, to see the Sentences,
which they had given, executed there; and that those Ecclesiastics
came with Orders from the Court for the Civil Magistrates to assist
them, where their Assistance should be required, or thought necessary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An End put to the<br/>Schism formed by</i><br/>Eulalius.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Schism formed by <i>Eulalius</i> was not, it seems, yet quite extinct
in <i>Rome</i> in the Year 425. for I find a Law of that Year, dated
the 17th of <i>July</i>, and addressed to <i>Faustus</i> Prefect of the City, commanding
all <i>Manichees</i>, Heretics, Schismatics, and Sects of every
Denomination, to be driven out of <i>Rome</i>; but more especially those,
who, separating themselves from the Communion of the <i>Venerable
Pope</i>, kept alive a dangerous Schism. Over these <i>Faustus</i> is injoined
to keep a watchful Eye, to summon them to communicate
with <i>Celestine</i>, and, if they did not comply with the Summons in
Twenty Days, to banish them an Hundred Miles from <i>Rome</i><a id='r1592' /><a href='#f1592' class='c015'><sup>[1592]</sup></a>. This
Law was issued by <i>Placidia</i>, who, upon the Death of her Brother
<i>Honorius</i>, which happened in the Month of <i>August</i> 423. and that of
the Usurper <i>John</i>, killed in 425, governed the Western Empire, as
Guardian to her Son <i>Valentinian</i> III. The Law she issued, probably
put an End to the Schism; for no further Mention is made of it by
any Historian.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>It was in the Time of <i>Celestine</i>, and the following Year 426. the
Fourth of his Pontificate, that the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, quite tired
out with the daily Encroachments of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, and not
able to brook the despotic and arbitrary Power which they had begun
to exercise over them, took the no less laudable than necessary
Resolution of breaking their Chains before they were thoroughly
riveted, and asserting their antient Liberty, by effectually removing
what had endangered it, the pernicious Abuse of appealing to <i>Rome</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Apiarius, <i>a Presbyter of</i> Sicca, <i>appeals to</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Incident, which gave Occasion to that Resolution, was the Appeal
of a Presbyter of <i>Sicca</i>, named <i>Apiarius</i>, who, being convicted of
many Crimes, and thereupon degraded and excommunicated by his
own Bishop <i>Urbanus</i>, appealed to <i>Zosimus</i> then Bishop of <i>Rome</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Zosimus <i>restores him to the Rank from which he had been degraded</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Zosimus</i>, who missed no Opportunity of acquiring new Power, or
improving the Power which he had acquired, not only received the
Appeal, but, without ever hearing the other Side, restored <i>Apiarius</i>
both to his Rank, and the Communion of the Church. This was the
boldest Attempt that had yet been made upon the Rights and Liberties
of the <i>African</i> Churches; and therefore the Bishops in those
Parts, all uniting in a Cause that was common to all, loudly complained
of such an arbitrary Act, as an open Violation of the Canons
of the Church, forbidding those, who had been excluded from the
Communion by their own Bishop, to be admitted to it by any other<a id='r1593' /><a href='#f1593' class='c015'><sup>[1593]</sup></a>.
<i>Zosimus</i>, finding the <i>African</i> Bishops had taken the Alarm, and were
determined to restrain his Power within the Limits prescribed to it
by the Canons, and, on the other hand, being well apprised, that he
could allege no Canons, that had ever been received by them, to
countenance the Power which he claimed, and had exercised, thought
it would be no great Crime to recur to Fraud on so urgent an Occasion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>To support his Pretensions, endeavours to impose upon the</i> African <i>Bishops the Canons of</i> Sardica <i>for the Canons of</i> Nice.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Agreeably to this Scheme, he caused Two Canons to be
transcribed from the Council of <i>Sardica</i>; the one allowing Presbyters
and Deacons, when rashly excommunicated by their own Bishops, to
appeal to the neighbouring Bishops; and the other, authorizing the
Appeal of all Bishops to the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. Had the <i>Africans</i>
received these Canons, he intended to have justified, by the former, his
judging and absolving <i>Apiarius</i>, notwithstanding the Distance between
<i>Rome</i> and <i>Numidia</i>; and, in virtue of the latter, to get the
Canon revoked, which the <i>African</i> Bishops had lately made, forbidding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>on Pain of Excommunication, Appeals <i>beyond Sea</i>; that
is, to <i>Rome</i>. Nothing less than an intire Subjection of the <i>African</i>
Churches to the See of <i>Rome</i> would satisfy the boundless Ambition
of <i>Zosimus</i>; and such a Subjection would infallibly have ensued, had
the Two above-mentioned Canons been received by the <i>African</i>
Bishops in the Sense which <i>Zosimus</i> did, and seemed determined to
make others, put upon them. But the main Point was, to persuade
the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> to admit such Canons, especially at so critical
a Juncture. The Council of <i>Sardica</i> had never been received there:
nay, they were, it seems, at this very Time, utter Strangers both to
that Council and its Canons; so that it was useless to quote them as
such. Of this <i>Zosimus</i> was aware; and therefore, as he stuck at
nothing that stood in the way of his Ambition, he resolved, by one
of the most impudent and barefaced Impostures recorded in History,
to try whether he could not impose upon the Bishops of <i>Africa</i> the
Canons of <i>Sardica</i> for the Canons of <i>Nice</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>With this View he sends a Solemn Embassy into</i> Africa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With this knavish View,
and to render the Imposture more solemn, and less suspected, he dispatched
into <i>Africa</i> Three Legates, <i>viz.</i> <i>Faustinus</i> Bishop of <i>Potentia</i>
in <i>Picenum</i>, and Two <i>Roman</i> Presbyters, <i>Philippus</i> and
<i>Asellus</i>. Their Instructions, contained in a Letter addressed to themselves,
were, to require of the <i>African</i> Bishops a strict Observance of
the Two above-mentioned Canons of <i>Nice</i>; to complain of their
repairing so often to Court; and to desire them not to communicate
with <i>Urbanus</i> of <i>Sicca</i>, who had deposed <i>Apiarius</i>, or even to send
him to <i>Rome</i>, if he refused to correct what he had done amiss<a id='r1594' /><a href='#f1594' class='c015'><sup>[1594]</sup></a>;
that is, we may suppose, if he did not restore <i>Apiarius</i> to his Rank,
and the Communion of the Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>With these Instructions the Legates set out for <i>Africa</i>, where they
no sooner arrived, than a Council was convened, at which assisted,
among the rest, <i>Alypius</i> Bishop of <i>Tagaste</i>, St. <i>Austin</i>’s great
Friend, and <i>Aurelius</i> Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>. When the Legates first
appeared before the Council, the Bishops desired them to lay their
Instructions before the Assembly; which they were at first unwilling
to do, contenting themselves with declaring their Commission by
Word of Mouth. But the <i>Africans</i> knowing whom they had to
deal with, and thereupon pressing them to communicate their Instructions
is Writing, they complied at last, and produced the Letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>I have mentioned above, which was immediately registred. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Surprize of the</i> African <i>Bishops on this Occasion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  When
it was publicly read, it is impossible to conceive the Surprize and
Astonishment that appeared in the whole Assembly. They had never
heard of those Canons; and to find them thus confidently ascribed
to the Council of <i>Nice</i>, was what appeared to them strange beyond
Expression. Warm Disputes arose, of which, however, we know
no Particulars. Several different <i>Greek</i> Copies, several <i>Latin</i> Copies,
were sent for, and carefully examined and compared; but no such
Canons could be found there. However, as the Legates continued
to maintain, with an unparalleled Impudence, the disputed Canons
of <i>Nice</i>, the Council agreed to observe them, till they had, by a
more diligent Inquiry, discovered the Truth<a id='r1595' /><a href='#f1595' class='c015'><sup>[1595]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>They continued their Sessions; but as they were few in Number,
as the Point in Dispute was of the utmost Consequence, and nearly
affected all the Bishops of <i>Africa</i>, they thought it should be communicated
to all; and that, without the Concurrence of all, no Resolution
should be taken. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A General Council assembled at</i> Carthage.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  A General Council was accordingly assembled
at <i>Carthage</i>, consisting of Two hundred and Seventeen Bishops, from
the different Provinces of <i>Africa</i>. They met, for the first time, on
the 25th of <i>May</i> 419. <i>Faustinus</i> being placed next after <i>Aurelius</i> of
<i>Carthage</i>, and <i>Valentine</i> Primate of <i>Numidia</i>, and the Two Presbyters
<i>Philippus</i> and <i>Asellus</i> after the other Bishops. Being all seated, <i>Aurelius</i>
moved, that the Canons of <i>Nice</i> might be read, from the
Copies which they had of that Council in <i>Africa</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Conduct of</i> Faustinus, <i>the Pope’s Legate, on this Occasion</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But this was
warmly opposed by <i>Faustinus</i>, insisting upon their reading, in the
first place, his Instructions, and coming to some Resolution concerning
the Observance of the Canons of <i>Nice</i>, which he was charged
by the Apostolic See to require of them. <i>It matters not</i>, said he,
<i>whether or no those Canons are to be found in your Copies, or, indeed,
in any other. You must know, that the Canons and Ordinances of</i>
Nice, <i>which have been handed down to us by Tradition, and established
by Custom, are no less binding than those that have been conveyed
to us in Writing</i>. To this Speech the Bishops returned no
Answer; without doubt, because they thought it deserved none.
However, at his Request, his Instructions were read, and warm Debates
ensued. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Resolution taken by the Council.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Alypius</i> was of Opinion, that since the disputed
Canons were not to be found in any of their Copies, Messengers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>Letters should be immediately dispatched to the Bishops of <i>Constantinople</i>,
<i>Alexandria</i>, and <i>Antioch</i>, for authentic Copies of the Acts
and Canons of <i>Nice</i>. This Proposal <i>Faustinus</i> highly resented, as an
Outrage offered to the Apostolic See, which, he said, was thereby arraigned
of Fraud and Forgery. He therefore advised them to write to
<i>Boniface</i>, who, by this time, had succeeded <i>Zosimus</i>, and, leaving
to him the Care of examining the Authority of those Canons, submit
the Whole to his Judgment, to his known Prudence and Discretion.
He added, that by acting otherwise they might give Occasion to
great Divisions and Disturbances in the Church. <i>Aurelius</i>, not to
exasperate the Legate, whom he found to be a Man of a haughty,
imperious, and intractable Temper, made no other Reply, but <i>that
they would write to</i> Boniface. St. <i>Austin</i> promised to observe those
Canons so long as it could be reasonably supposed that they were the
Canons of <i>Nice</i>. The other Bishops made the same Promise; which
was confirming the Resolution the Council had taken the Year before.
Here the Legate exaggerated anew the Affront they offered to the
<i>Roman</i> Church; adding, that the only Reparation they could make,
for questioning the Authenticity of Canons proposed by her, was
to leave the deciding of that Point to her, and acquiesce in her
Judgment. But the Warmth, the Earnestness, the Passion which he
betrayed in his Speech, and in his whole Conduct, served only to
heighten the Jealousy, and confirm the Suspicions, of the <i>African</i>
Bishops. It was therefore universally agreed, in spite of the Remonstrances,
Intreaties, and Menaces of the Legate, that <i>Aurelius</i> should
write to the Bishops of <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>Alexandria</i>, and <i>Antioch</i>,
for authentic Copies of the Canons of <i>Nice</i>: that if the Canons,
quoted by <i>Faustinus</i>, were found in those Copies, they should be
punctually observed; if not, that a new Council should be convened,
and such Resolutions taken, as the Fathers, who composed it, should
think proper<a id='r1596' /><a href='#f1596' class='c015'><sup>[1596]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Affair of</i> Apiarius,<br/><i>how settled by the<br/>Council.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Matters being thus settled, with respect to the pretended Canons
of <i>Nice</i>, concerning Appeals, the Council took next into Consideration
the Case of <i>Apiarius</i> which had given Occasion to the present
Dispute between <i>Rome</i> and <i>Africa</i>; and it was agreed, that
<i>Apiarius</i> should make the due Submission to his Bishop, and there
upon be re-admitted to his Communion, and restored to his Rank.
However, as he had given great Offence to the People of <i>Sicca</i>, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>his scandalous Life, he was ordered, by the Council, to quit that
City; but, at the same time, allowed to exercise the Functions of his
Office in any other Place<a id='r1597' /><a href='#f1597' class='c015'><sup>[1597]</sup></a>. This Medium the Council wisely chose
between the Two opposite Sentences; that of <i>Urbanus</i> excommunicating
and deposing him, and that of <i>Zosimus</i> restoring him to the
Communion and the Priesthood. Such was the Issue of the Appeal
of <i>Apiarius</i>: and I leave the Reader to judge, whether <i>Baronius</i>
should boast of it as he does. And now nothing remained, but to
acquaint <i>Boniface</i> with the Acts and Resolutions of the Council;
and this was done accordingly by a Letter, which they all signed, and
delivered to the Legates. In that Letter they begged <i>Boniface</i> to
procure, from the East, authentic Copies of the Canons of <i>Nice</i>, promising
to observe the Canons in Dispute, till such Copies were procured;
but this upon Condition, that if those Canons were not
found to be genuine, they should recover their antient Privileges, and
not be forced to <i>submit to a Yoke, which Ambition alone could impose</i><a id='r1598' /><a href='#f1598' class='c015'><sup>[1598]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> African <i>Bishops<br/>write into the East<br/>for authentic Copies<br/>of the Council of</i><br/>Nice.</div>

<p class='c001'>With this Letter the Three Legates set out from <i>Africa</i>, on their
Return to <i>Rome</i>. Upon their Departure, the <i>African</i> Bishops writ,
agreeably to the Resolution they had taken, to <i>Atticus</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>,
and <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, begging they would cause to be
transcribed, and sent into <i>Africa</i>, the most authentic Copies they
had of the Canons of <i>Nice</i>. With this Request the Two Bishops
readily complied; and the same Year 419. the Messengers sent to
<i>Alexandria</i> and <i>Constantinople</i> returned with the wished-for Copies,
and very friendly and obliging Answers, which are still extant<a id='r1599' /><a href='#f1599' class='c015'><sup>[1599]</sup></a>, from
<i>Cyril</i> and <i>Atticus</i>, addressed <i>to</i> Aurelius, <i>to</i> Valentine, <i>and to all the
Bishops of</i> Africa <i>assembled at</i> Carthage. As for the Bisop of <i>Antioch</i>,
the <i>Africans</i> probably did not write to him; at least, they
had no Answer from him<a id='rN69' /><a href='#fN69' class='c015'><sup>[N69]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The pretended Canons not found in those Copies, and the Dispute dropt by</i> Boniface.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> They immediately compared the Two
Copies, sent them from the East, with their own, especially with
that which <i>Cæcilianus</i> of <i>Carthage</i> had brought with him from
<i>Nice</i>, where he had assisted at the Council; and found them agree
in every Particular, without any Trace of the Canons that <i>Zosimus</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>had produced: upon which they dispatched the same Ecclesiastics with
them to <i>Rome</i>, whom they had sent into the East. <i>Boniface</i>, who
was an Enemy to all Fraud and Imposition, acquiesced; the Dispute
was dropped; so that the Canon, which the <i>African</i> Bishops had
lately made, forbidding Appeals to <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Zosimus</i> had thus fraudulently
attempted to defeat, remained in its full Vigour; and the
Churches of <i>Africa</i> were suffered quietly to enjoy their antient
Rights and Privileges, so long as <i>Boniface</i> lived. But in the Pontificate
of his Successor <i>Celestine</i>, the Storm broke out anew.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN69'>N69</a>. It is very observable, that the <i>Alexandrian</i>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Power of receiv-<br/>ing Appeals claimed by<br/>the Popes only as<br/>granted by the<br/>Canons.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>It may not be improper here to observe, that <i>Zosimus</i>, though
wholly bent on exalting his See, and straining every Prerogative to
the highest Pitch, yet did not presume to exalt it above the Canons;
did not claim the disputed Power of receiving Appeals, of judging,
deciding, <i>&amp;c.</i> independently of the Canons. And was not this owning
himself, but for the Canons, to be upon the Level with the other
Bishops his Collegues; at least in respect to this Point? Is not the
scandalous Method, which he took on this Occasion to extend his
own Power, and curtail that of the <i>African</i> Bishops, a Demonstration
of his deriving his Claim from the Canons alone? Could there
ever offer a better Opportunity, could there ever occur a more urgent
Necessity, of asserting a <i>Divine Right</i>? As <i>Zosimus</i> therefore never
asserted, nor even mentioned, such a Right, we may well conclude,
that he either had no Notion of it, or did not think it sufficiently
grounded to be of any Use in the present Dispute. And yet this
<i>Divine Right</i> of receiving Appeals from all Parts of the World, of
constituting, confirming, judging, censuring, suspending, deposing,
removing, restoring Bishops, and all other Ecclesiastics, is now held,
as an Article of Faith, by all true <i>Roman</i> Catholics; insomuch that
to dispute such an Article, would be no less dangerous, in Countries
where the Inquisition prevails, than to dispute any Article of the
<i>Apostolic</i> or <i>Nicene</i> Creed. It is true, <i>Innocent</i> the First, as the Advocates
for the See of <i>Rome</i> observe, had claimed, by <i>Divine Right</i>,
the Power of finally deciding all Controversies. But he himself seems
to have been sensible, that he had gone too far, For what else could
have induced him to restrain that Claim, as soon as he had set it up,
to <i>Matters of Faith alone</i><a id='r1600' /><a href='#f1600' class='c015'><sup>[1600]</sup></a>? Had <i>Zosimus</i> thought the general Claim
capable of being maintained, he need not have recurred, as he did,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>to Fraud and Imposture. The Pretensions of <i>Innocent</i>, in their utmost
Extent, were indeed renewed, in Process of Time, by his Successors;
but not till the intolerable Abuse, which they made of the
Power granted them by the Canons of <i>Sardica</i>, on which they
founded all their Usurpations, obliged other Councils to revoke
those Canons; and then it was, that, no other Means being left of
maintaining their ill-gotten Power, they revived the Claim of <i>Innocent</i>,
and, challenging no longer by the Canons, but by <i>Divine
Right</i>, the Prerogative of receiving Appeals, they put it out of the
Power of all future Councils to abridge or restrain it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Whether</i> Zosimus<br/><i>ignorantly mistook the<br/>Canons of</i> Sardica<br/><i>for those of</i> Nice.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Three Cardinals <i>Baronius</i>, <i>Bellarmine</i>, and <i>Noris</i>, thinking
the Imputation of Ignorance less injurious to the Memory of <i>Zosimus</i>,
less derogatory to the Dignity of the Apostolic See, than that of
Fraud and Imposture, suppose him to have ignorantly mistaken the
Canons of <i>Sardica</i> for the Canons of <i>Nice</i>; which is supposing, that
in the whole Archives of the <i>Roman</i> Church there was not a single
genuine Copy of the Council of <i>Nice</i>, or that <i>Zosimus</i> had never
perused it; and to suppose either is highly absurd. Besides, the whole
Conduct of the Legate, the Pains he took to divert the <i>African</i> Bishops
from consulting other Copies, and, when he could not prevail,
his recurring to <i>unwritten</i> Canons; and, as that too proved ineffectual,
his striving by all possible means to persuade the <i>Africans</i> to leave
to the Pope the Care of examining other Copies, and to acquiesce,
without any further Inquiry, in what should thereupon be determined
by him; plainly shews, that the Legate was privy to the Fraud, and
apprehended a Detection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Apiarius <i>excommun-<br/>icated anew. He ap-<br/>peals again to</i> Rome,<br/><i>and is restored<br/>by</i> Celestine, <i>and<br/>sent back attended<br/>by the Legate</i><br/>Faustinus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Apiarius</i>, being obliged to quit <i>Sicca</i>, as I have related above, retired
to <i>Tabraca</i>, another City of <i>Numidia</i>, and led there so scandalous
a Life, that he was excommunicated anew. Hereupon he appealed
again to <i>Rome</i>, and <i>Celestine</i>, which is very surprising, notwithstanding
the vigorous Opposition which his Predecessors had, but
very lately, met with from the <i>African</i> Bishops, in attempting to restore
this very Presbyter, not only declared him innocent, and admitted
him to his Communion, but sent him back into <i>Africa</i>,
attended by the Legate <i>Faustinus</i>, who was ordered to see him reinstated.
The <i>Africans</i> were but too well acquainted already with
the Presumption and Arrogance of the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>; and yet
such an insolent Act quite surprised them. For <i>Celestine</i> had neither
examined the Crimes, which <i>Apiarius</i> was charged with, nor heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>the Witnesses, nor even condescended to let them know, that he
intended to judge him anew. He writ, indeed, Two Letters to
them on this Occasion, but which seemed merely designed to insult
them: for, by the First, he gave them Notice of the Arrival of <i>Apiarius</i>
at <i>Rome</i>, which, he said, had given him great Joy; and by the
Second, which was brought by <i>Faustinus</i>, he acquainted them, that
he was overjoyed to have found him innocent. From this despotic
and extraordinary way of acting, the <i>African</i> Bishops concluded, that
<i>Celestine</i> was determined to keep no Measures with them, and that
nothing less than an intire Subjection of the <i>African</i> Churches to the
See of <i>Rome</i> would satisfy his Ambition. But they were resolved
to maintain, at all Events, the Liberty wherewith Christ had made
them free. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A General Council assembled.</i> Apiarius <i>appears before it, with</i> Faustinus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  A General Council was therefore assembled, and <i>Apiarius</i>
summoned to attend. He obeyed the Summons, and appeared
before the Council at the Time appointed, but in Company with
<i>Faustinus</i>, shewing thereby, that he placed greater Confidence in him
than in his own Innocence. <i>Faustinus</i> spoke first, and pressed, with
great Warmth, the Fathers of the Assembly to re-admit <i>Apiarius</i> to
their Communion, since he had been declared innocent by the Apostolic
See, and admitted by <i>Celestine</i> to the Communion of the
<i>Roman</i> Church. The Bishops replied, that in <i>Africa</i> <i>Apiarius</i> had
been found guilty, and that in <i>Africa</i> his Innocence must be made to
appear, before they could receive him again to their Communion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Legate’s insolent Conduct.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As
they stuck to this Point, <i>Faustinus</i> undertook his Cause; but, instead
of proving, as he had promised to do, or even attempting to prove
his Innocence, he inveighed, from the Beginning of his Speech to the
End, and in very harsh and opprobrious Language, against the Council,
and all the Members, who composed it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Apiarius <i>pleads his own Cause</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Apiarius</i> was sensible,
that the Speech of <i>Faustinus</i>, instead of reconciling the <i>African</i> Bishops
to him, had incensed them more than ever against him; and therefore
thinking it adviseable to take the Cause into his own Hands, he
stood up as soon as the other had done; and, with a Modesty capable,
as he thought, of atoning for the Insolence of <i>Faustinus</i>, endeavoured
to clear himself from the Crimes that had been laid to his
Charge. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Faustinus <i>assists him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  When he had spoken, the Witnesses against him were heard;
and the Tryal lasted Three whole Days, <i>Apiarius</i> striving, with great
Art and Subtilty, to invalidate the Depositions, and <i>Faustinus</i>
prompting him when he was at a Stand. He might, perhaps, have
escaped Condemnation, partly by his own Craft and Address, partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>by the powerful Protection of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, had he been able
to withstand the Stings of his own Conscience. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Apiarius, <i>struck with sudden Remorse, owns the Crimes laid to his Charge</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But, on the Fourth
Day, when <i>Faustinus</i> began to triumph as sure of Victory, <i>Apiarius</i>,
struck with sudden Remorse, damped at once all his Joy, by voluntarily
owning, to the great Surprize of all present, and the unspeakable
Confusion of <i>Faustinus</i>, every Crime with which he had been
charged. Those Crimes the Fathers have thought fit to wrap in
Oblivion; and indeed it was not proper, that Posterity should know
them; since they were <i>heinous, incredible, such as ought not to be
mentioned, and drew Sighs and Tears from the whole Assembly</i><a id='r1601' /><a href='#f1601' class='c015'><sup>[1601]</sup></a>.
And this is the Man whom Two Popes, both now worshiped as
Saints in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, absolved as innocent; and, as innocent,
would have supported with Force and Violence, had not Providence
almost miraculously interposed, to prevent the Evils that
would have ensued. They could not but know, that <i>Apiarius</i> was
guilty; at least they did not know, that he was innocent. But as he
had been declared guilty in <i>Africa</i>, their declaring him innocent,
whether he was so or not, gave them an Opportunity of renewing the
Attempts of the Apostolic See on the Liberties of the <i>African</i>
Churches; and it was, no doubt, with this View that they absolved
and restored him. But, as he was not hardened enough in Iniquity
for their Purpose, he owned himself guilty, in spite of their Judgment
declaring him innocent, and thereby defeated their Schemes for the
present. For the <i>Africans</i>, now sensible that there was no Wickedness
which the Bishops of <i>Rome</i> would not countenance, in order to
establish their Power in <i>Africa</i>, to the utter Subversion of all Ecclesiastical
Order and Discipline there, thought themselves bound, as they
tendered the Welfare, Peace, and Tranquillity of the Churches committed
to their Care, to act with that Vigour and Steadiness, which
so urgent an Occasion seemed to require. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> African <i>Bishops renew the Canon forbidding Appeals to</i> Rome.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Accordingly they first absolutely
cut off <i>Apiarius</i> from the Communion of the Church; then
renewed, in stronger Terms than ever, the Canon, which had given
so great Offence at <i>Rome</i>, prohibiting, on Pain of Excommunication,
Appeals <i>beyond Sea</i>, under any Pretence whatsoever; and this Prohibition
they extended to Ecclesiastics of all Conditions and Ranks.
<i>Faustinus</i> blustered, vapoured, threatened; but all in vain. The Bishops
not only signed, all to a Man, the above-mentioned Canon, but
writ a Synodal Letter to <i>Celestine</i>, acquainting him with what had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>passed in the Case of <i>Apiarius</i>, and earnestly intreating him not to
give Ear for the future to those, who should have recourse to him
from <i>Africa</i>, nor receive to his Communion such as they had excluded
from theirs: <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their Letter to</i> Celestine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>For we must let your Venerableness</i> (Venerabilitas

of</i> Nice. <i>And though Mention is there made of Clerks only, and
Laymen; yet there is no room to doubt but it was their Intention,
that such a Regulation should extend to Bishops too; and it would be
a great Irregularity, should your Holiness</i> (a Title then common to
all Bishops) <i>over-hastily and unduly admit to your Communion Bishops,
who have been excommunicated in their own Provinces. Your
Holiness therefore must not receive the Presbyters, and other Clerks,
who, to avoid the Punishment, which they deserve, recur to you;
the rather as we know of no Constitutions thus derogatory to the
Authority of our Churches; and the Council of</i> Nice <i>has subjected
the Bishops themselves to the judgment of their Metropolitan. The
Fathers of that Council have decreed, with great Wisdom and Equity,
that all Disputes should be finally determined in the Places where
they began, being sensible, that the Grace of the Holy Spirit, necessary
for judging rightly, would not be wanting in any Province;
especially as every Man, who thinks himself injured, may apply for
Redress, if he pleases, to the Synod of his own Province, or to a
national Council. Would it not be Presumption in any of us to suppose
or imagine, that God will inspire a particular Person with the
Spirit of Justice, and refuse it to many Bishops assembled in Council?
And how can a Judgment, given out of the Country, and beyond Sea,
be right, where the necessary Witnesses cannot be present, by reason of
their Sex, of their Age, or of some other Impediment? As for your
sending Legates, we find no such Ordinance in any Council, nor in
the Writings of the Fathers. As for what you have sent us by
our Collegue</i> Faustinus, <i>as a Canon of the Council of</i> Nice, <i>we must
let you know, that no such Canon is to be found in the genuine and
uncorrupt Copies of that Council, which have been transcribed and
sent us by our Fellow-Bishop</i> Cyril <i>of</i> Alexandria, <i>and the Reverend</i>
Atticus <i>of</i> Constantinople. <i>Those Copies we sent to</i> Boniface, <i>your

them<a id='r1602' /><a href='#f1602' class='c015'><sup>[1602]</sup></a>. <i>Celestine</i>, finding the Spirit with which they acted, and sensible
that it would be useless to employ Force at this Juncture, thought
it advisable to acquiesce for the present, and wait till a more favourable
Opportunity should offer for him, or his Successors, to renew

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN70'>N70</a>. <i>Schelstrate</i> would make us believe,
that <i>Gregory the Great</i> prevailed upon the
<i>African</i> Bishops to revoke the Canon forbidding
the Presbyters and inferior Clergy to
appeal to <i>Rome</i><a id='rN70.1' /><a href='#fN70.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>; and <i>Davidius</i>, That
the <i>Africans</i> changed their Minds with respect
to the Appeals of Bishops, as soon as
they were informed, that such Appeals had
been allowed, and approved of, by the
Council of <i>Sardica</i><a id='rN70.2' /><a href='#fN70.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. But neither alleges
any solid Reason, or even Conjecture, to
prove Facts of such Importance; nay, what
<i>Davidius</i> advances is certainly false, since
the Canons forbidding all Appeals to <i>Rome</i>,
made at this time, were still quoted among
the other Canons of the <i>African Collection</i>
in 825. and confirmed by a Council held at
<i>Carthage</i> that Year<a id='rN70.3' /><a href='#fN70.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Some pretend that

from the <i>African</i> Bishops, and that this Separation
continued between their Churches,
and that of <i>Rome</i>, till the Beginning of the
VIIth Century, when <i>Eulalius</i> of <i>Carthage</i>,

<p class='c001'>The following Year 427. <i>Sisinius</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i> being
dead, the Bishops in those Parts were for appointing <i>Proculus</i> in his
room. But, as <i>Proculus</i> had been ordained before, though never installed
Bishop of <i>Cyzicus</i>, they were under some Apprehension, lest
his Promotion to the See of <i>Constantinople</i> should be deemed a Breach
of the Canons forbidding Translations. But <i>Celestine</i>, whom they
consulted on this Occasion, delivered them from that Apprehension,
declaring, in a Letter, which he writ at this time to <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>,
<i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, and <i>Rufus</i> of <i>Thessalonica</i>, that they might
safely place on one See a Bishop named to another, nay, and a Bishop
who actually governed another<a id='r1603' /><a href='#f1603' class='c015'><sup>[1603]</sup></a>; that is, he declared Translations
lawful<a id='rN71' /><a href='#fN71' class='c015'><sup>[N71]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN71'>N71</a>. Against Translations there may be
Reasons in Policy; but there can be none
in Conscience; and none that are at all to
the Purpose, have been alleged either by
the Councils, or Fathers, though the former
have exerted all their Authority to prevent
them, and the latter all their Oratory to
make them appear criminal. The Councils
of <i>Arles</i>, of <i>Nice</i>, of <i>Alexandria</i>, of
<i>Sardica</i>, of <i>Chalcedon</i>, of <i>Antioch</i>, forbid
them on the severest Penalties the Church
could inflict. The Council of <i>Sardica</i>, by
its First Canon deprived such Bishops, as
should change their Churches, even of the
Lay-Communion: and because some pleaded,
or at least the Council apprehended
they might plead, the Desire and Request
of the People; to leave no room for such
an Excuse, the Council by its Second Canon
deprived those, who should allege it, of the
Lay-Communion, even at the Point of
Death<a id='rN71.1' /><a href='#fN71.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The Council of <i>Alexandria</i>,
under St. <i>Athanasius</i>, in their Epistle to all
the Catholic Bishops, speak thus of <i>Eusebius</i>,
who had been translated from <i>Berytus</i>
to <i>Nicomedia</i>: Eusebius <i>did not reflect on the
Admonition of the Apostle, Art thou bound to
a Wife? Do not seek to be loosed. For if it
be said of a Woman, how much more of a
Church? To which if one is tied, he ought
not to seek another; that he may not be likewise
found an Adulterer, according to the
Scripture</i><a id='rN71.2' /><a href='#fN71.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. What Analogy between a
Wife, and a Bishoprick? The Bishops of
that Assembly were even of Opinion, that
<i>Eusebius</i>, by abandoning his former Church
had annulled his Episcopacy. In the Synod
under <i>Mennas</i> it was laid to the Charge of
<i>Anthimus</i>, that being Bishop of <i>Trebisond</i>,
he had <i>adulterously</i> seized on the See of
<i>Constantinople</i><a id='rN71.3' /><a href='#fN71.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. In the same Strain have
the Fathers declaimed against Translations,
whenever an Opportunity offered of bringing
in that favourite Topic; for the Canons
and Decisions of the Councils were only
the private Opinions of the major Part of
the Bishops, who composed them. They
generally inveigh against that <i>adulterous
Traffick</i>, as if they supposed a Bishop to be
married to the Church, which he was ordained
to serve, or tied to it by Bonds no
less indissoluble than a Husband to his Wife:
And it was upon that Supposition, that
they charged with Adultery those, who
passed from one Church to another. But
that Supposition none of them have been
able to make good either from Scripture or
Reason. As for the Command of the
Apostle in his Letter to <i>Timothy</i>, <i>A Bishop
must be the Husband of one Wife</i>, which
some of them have interpreted as levelled
against Translations; the far greater Part
both of the Fathers and Councils have in
that Passage understood the Word <i>Wife</i>,
not in a metaphorical, but a natural Sense,
and thereupon excluded from the Episcopal
Dignity such as had been twice married.
But allowing St. <i>Paul</i> to have meant a
<i>Church</i> by the Word <i>Wife</i>, the most obvious
and natural Interpretation we can give
to his Words, is, that he there forbids Pluralities
of Bishopricks, which were once
very common in the Church of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But whatever Reasons the Fathers and
Councils may have alleged, or could allege,
against Translations, they have themselves
defeated them all by the contrary Practice.
For some of the greatest Saints, and Lights
of the Church, have been either translated,
or approved and promoted the Translations
of others. The famous <i>Methodius</i>, who
suffered under <i>Diocletian</i> in the Year 311.
or 312. passed from the See of <i>Olympus</i> in
<i>Lycia</i> to that of <i>Tyre</i><a id='rN71.4' /><a href='#fN71.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>. <i>Eustathius</i>, who
is supposed to have presided at the Council
of <i>Nice</i>, was translated from <i>Ber&oelig;a</i> to
<i>Antioch</i>, that is, from a small See to the
second in the East<a id='rN71.5' /><a href='#fN71.5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>; nay, <i>Sozomen</i> ascribes
this Translation to the Council of
<i>Nice</i> itself<a id='rN71.6' /><a href='#fN71.6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>. <i>Syderius</i>, Bishop of <i>Erythra</i>
in <i>Libya</i>, was translated by <i>Athanasius</i> to
<i>Ptolemais</i>, the Metropolis of the whole
<i>Pentapolis</i><a id='rN71.7' /><a href='#fN71.7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>. <i>Euphronius</i> Bishop of <i>Colonia</i>,
a small Town on the Borders of <i>Armenia</i>,
was by a Synod, consisting of all the
Orthodox Bishops of that Province, translated
to the Metropolitan See of <i>Nicopolis</i>;
that Translation was highly applauded by
St. <i>Basil</i>, who thought it owing not to human
Prudence, but to a particular Inspiration
of the Holy Ghost<a id='rN71.8' /><a href='#fN71.8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>; the <i>Arians</i>
being very powerful in that City, and no
Man more fit to make head against them
than <i>Euphronius</i>. The Inhabitants of <i>Colonia</i>
were very unwilling to part with their
Bishop; and the Ecclesiastics there even
threatened to join the <i>Arian</i> Party, if <i>Euphronius</i>
was taken from them<a id='rN71.9' /><a href='#fN71.9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. But
they were in the End prevailed upon
by St. <i>Basil</i> to acquiesce in the Will of
God, who, said he, had inspired the Prelates
with such a Resolution<a id='rN71.10' /><a href='#fN71.10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a>. From
these (and many other Instances might be
alleged) it is manifest, that the Fathers
spoke like mere Declaimers, when they
compared a Bishop, who left one Church,
and took another, to a Husband, who
abandoned his Wife, and married another
Woman. But indeed they only inveighed
thus, generally speaking, against Translations,
when the Persons translated were of
the Party, which they opposed; it was
then Adultery, it was forfeiting the Episcopal
Dignity, to pass from one Church to
another. But when they apprehended, that
such Changes could any-ways promote the
Cause which they had espoused and maintained,
those Changes were thereby sanctified,
and owing to a particular Inspiration
of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pope <i>Gelasius</i> II. excused Translations
by the Example of St. <i>Peter</i>. <i>Who dares to
maintain</i>, says he, <i>that St.</i> Peter, <i>the Prince
of the Apostles, was to blame, for changing
the See of</i> Antioch <i>for that of</i> Rome<a id='rN71.11' /><a href='#fN71.11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a>?
And who dares to maintain, that any
Bishop is to blame for doing what the Prince
of the Apostles had done before him? But
were there no other Instances, besides that
of St. <i>Peter</i>, to give a Sanction to Translations,
I should readily grant them never to
have been allowed in the Church. For St.
<i>Peter</i> never was Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, as I have
shewn already<a id='rN71.12' /><a href='#fN71.12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a>; and some of the
Reasons, proving him never to have been
Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, make equally against his
pretended Episcopacy of <i>Antioch</i>. Most of
the Ecclesiastical Writers indeed suppose him
to have been Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>; but St.
<i>Luke</i> is quite silent on that Head, though
within the Compass of his History, as <i>Jerom</i>
observed<a id='rN71.13' /><a href='#fN71.13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a>; and his Silence ought
to be of more Weight, than the Authority
of Writers, who lived some Ages after.
<i>Origen</i>, who flourished in the Third Century,
was the first who mentioned St. <i>Peter</i>’s See
of <i>Antioch</i>, saying, It was held by <i>Ignatius</i>
after him<a id='rN71.14' /><a href='#fN71.14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a>. <i>Origen</i> was copied by <i>Eusebius</i>,
and <i>Eusebius</i> by those, who came
after him.</p>

<p class='c001'>On Translations a modern Writer of the
Court of <i>Rome</i> reasons thus: “Translations
have been severely censured by the
Fathers, and often condemned both by
the Popes and the Councils. But neither
can the Councils tie the Hands of the
Popes, nor can one Pope tie the Hands
of another. The Power of dispensing
with all canonical Impediments the Popes
hold by Divine Right; which therefore
can only be restrained by divine Authority.
However, Translations ought not to be
allowed, but on most urgent Occasions;
and it is in order to prevent them, that
the Popes have adopted the wise Regulations
of some well-governed Republics,
where certain Goods are not prohibited,
but loaded with such Customs as are next
to a Prohibition<a id='rN71.15' /><a href='#fN71.15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a>.” The Canons
were made for the Good of the Church,
and the People; and therefore cannot be
binding when they oppose either. Hence
it follows, that there being in such Cases no
Room left for a Dispensation, nothing ought
in Justice to be exacted for it. And yet,
let the Occasion be ever so urgent, a very
considerable Sum must be paid into the
Apostolic Chamber for the pretended Dispensation.
If the Occasion is not urgent,
they allow the Canons to be binding; and
what can induce the Popes to dispense with
them, but that, which one of them taxed
those Bishops with, who seek Translations,
<i>Avarice, filthy Lucre, and an ungodly Desire
of greater Wealth</i><a id='rN71.16' /><a href='#fN71.16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a>? as if the Canons
had been made with no other View but to
give the Popes an Opportunity of filling
their Coffers by granting Leave to transgress
them.</p>

of <i>Rufus</i>; which was restraining to the See of <i>Thessalonica</i>, that
is, engrossing to himself (for the Bishop of <i>Thessalonica</i> acted only as
his Vicar), the Privileges, which the Council of <i>Nice</i> had granted
to all Metropolitans. It is observable, that in this very Letter <i>Celestine</i>
affects an intire Obedience to the Canons of the Church. <i>We ought</i>,
says he, <i>to subject our Will to the Rules, and not the Rules to our
Will; we ought to conform to the Canons, and strictly observe what
they prescribe</i><a id='r1604' /><a href='#f1604' class='c015'><sup>[1604]</sup></a>. But he did not govern himself by this Maxim upon
other Occasions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>He complains of<br/>several Abuses that<br/>prevailed in some<br/>Churches of</i> Gaul.</div>

<p class='c001'>The following Year 428, he wrote a long Letter to the Bishops of
the Provinces of <i>Vienne</i> and <i>Narbonne</i>, against several Abuses that prevailed
in those Parts. This Letter he begins quite in the Style of a
modern Pope: <i>As I am</i>, says he, <i>appointed by God to watch over
his Church, it is incumbent upon me every-where to root out evil Practices,
and introduce good ones in their room; for my Pastoral Vigilance
is restrained by no Bounds, but extends to all Places, where
Christ is known and adored</i>. Thus, under the Name of <i>Pastoral Vigilance</i>
he extends, at once, his Authority and Jurisdiction over all
the Churches of the Christian World. The first Abuse he complains
of was a particular Dress assumed by some Bishops, wearing, in Imitation
of the Monks, a Cloke and Girdle. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bishops not distinguished formerly by their Dress from the Laity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With this Novelty <i>Celestine</i>
finds great Fault, and exhorts the Bishops to distinguish themselves
from the People by their Doctrine, and not by their Garments, by
the Sanctity of their Manners, and not by the Mode of their Dress,
by the internal Purity of their Souls, and not by the external Attire
of their Bodies. What a large Field would the so many different and
ridiculous Habits of the Monks and Friers, the costly Attire of Bishops
and Cardinals, and, above all, the gorgeous and stately Apparel of
<i>Celestine</i>’s own Successors, have opened for his Zeal, had he lived in our
Days! He pleasantly adds, that if they understood, in a literal Sense, the
Words of our Saviour, <i>Let your Loins be girded about</i><a id='r1605' /><a href='#f1605' class='c015'><sup>[1605]</sup></a>, they ought
to interpret other Passages after the same manner, and never appear
without Lamps and Staves in their Hands. And was not this condemning,
at least ridiculing, the Monkish Habits, an essential Part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>which is the Girdle<a id='rN72' /><a href='#fN72' class='c015'><sup>[N72]</sup></a>? The other Abuses, which <i>Celestine</i> wanted
to have redressed, have nothing new in them, or that has not been
mentioned before in this History; and therefore I omit repeating them
here.</p>

<div class='note-container'>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='footnote' id='fN72'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN72'>N72</a>. From this Passage it is manifest, that
in those Days the Bishops, and other Ecclesiastics,
were not yet distinguished by their
Dress from the Laity, at least when they
were not actually discharging the Functions
of their Office. Whether they used even
then any particular Dress or Attire, may be
justly questioned. <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i> thinks
they did not<a id='rN72.1' /><a href='#fN72.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>; and F. <i>Sirmond</i> is of the
same Opinion. For, according to <i>Sirmond</i>,
the Ecclesiastics used no other Dress in the
Church, but that which they wore daily
out of the Church. However, as they reserved
the best Habits they had for the Sacred
Functions, and used them on no other
Occasion, when Modes in Dress began
to alter, the Fashion changed before they
were worn out. Thus, by Degrees, the
Dress, which they used in the Church, varied
from their common Dress, as well as
from that of the People; the new Habits
for the Service of the Church being made
after the Mode of the antient, in which
they were accustomed to perform their
Functions. <i>Anastasius</i>, <i>Platina</i>, and <i>Baronius</i>,
give us particular Accounts, I may
say, the History of every Part of the Mass-Priest’s
Dress, instituted, according to them,
and used long before this time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The</i> Pelagian <i>Doctrine<br/>prevails in</i> Britain.</div>

<p class='c001'>About this time the <i>Pelagian</i> Doctrine began to prevail, almost
universally, in <i>Britain</i>, being preached here either by the Natives,
who had adhered to their Countryman <i>Pelagius</i> abroad, and were
returned home, or by others, who, finding themselves, in virtue of
the Imperial Laws, every-where persecuted on the Continent, had
fled to this Island for Shelter. The leading Man of the Party here was
one <i>Agricola</i>, the Son of a <i>British</i> Bishop named <i>Severianus</i><a id='r1606' /><a href='#f1606' class='c015'><sup>[1606]</sup></a>. But
that <i>Severianus</i> himself, or any of his Collegues, countenanced their
Doctrine, is not touched by any of the Antients. <i>Fastidius</i> indeed,
a <i>British</i> Writer, who flourished at this time, betrays, in his Writings,
a strong Byas to the <i>Pelagian</i> Tenets. But it may be justly
questioned whether he was a Bishop. For in the Treatise which he
wrote on the Duties of a Christian Life, he makes Excuses for taking
upon him to instruct others; which a Bishop would hardly have done,
that being his Province and Duty<a id='rN73' /><a href='#fN73' class='c015'><sup>[N73]</sup></a>. However, if the <i>British</i> Bishops
did not countenance the <i>Pelagian</i> Doctrine, neither did they oppose
it, at least with the Vigour they might; else it had never made, in so
short a time, the Progress it did. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Britons <i>recur to the</i> Gallican <i>Bishops, who send</i> Germanus <i>and</i> Lupus <i>into</i> Britain.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Catholics, having no Prospect
of Relief from their own Pastors, had recourse to those of <i>Gaul</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>who, being affected with their Complaints, immediately summoned a
great Council, and chose, with one Voice, St. <i>Germanus</i> Bishop of
<i>Auxerre</i>, and St. <i>Lupus</i> Bishop of <i>Troyes</i>, to pass over into <i>Britain</i>,
and there maintain the Catholic Cause<a id='r1607' /><a href='#f1607' class='c015'><sup>[1607]</sup></a>. Thus <i>Constantius</i>, a Presbyter
of <i>Lyons</i>, who lived in this Century, and after him <i>Bede</i>. But
<i>Prosper</i>, who flourished likewise in this Century, writes, that the
Two Prelates were sent into <i>Britain</i> by <i>Celestine</i><a id='r1608' /><a href='#f1608' class='c015'><sup>[1608]</sup></a>. The <i>Gallican</i> Bishops,
perhaps, acquainted the Pope with the Choice they had made,
and he approved it; which was enough for <i>Prosper</i>, a notorious Flatterer
of the Popes, to ascribe the Whole to <i>Celestine</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their Journey.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The Two
Missionaries set out for <i>Britain</i> in the Latter-end of the Year 429. and,
passing through <i>Paris</i>, had an Interview there with the famous St.
<i>Genevieve</i>, who, at the Persuasion of St. <i>Germanus</i>, to whom her
future Sanctity was revealed, promised to consecrate her Virginity to
<i>Jesus Christ</i>. From <i>Paris</i> they pursued their Journey to the Sea-side,
and embarqued; but were very near being cast away by a Storm, before
they reached the <i>British</i> Coast. This Storm the Author supposes to
have been raised by the Devil; but we may more reasonably suppose it
to have been raised by himself, that he might have an Opportunity of
displaying the Power of his Imagination in describing it, and make
room for the Miracle by which it was laid. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Miracles wrought by them on the Sea, and after their Landing.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For St. <i>Germanus</i>, who
had slept the whole time, being awaked by the Mariners just as the
Vessel was on the point of sinking, first reprimanded the Sea, as <i>Neptune</i>
did of old the Winds, for attempting to defeat their pious Undertaking;
and then pouring into it a few Drops of Oil, asswaged at
once the Fury of the Waves, and miraculously restored the wished for
Calm. Upon their Landing, the People flocked to them from all Parts;
and, being convinced of the Truth which they preached, by the Miracles
which they wrought, abjured daily by Thousands the <i>Pelagian</i>
Doctrine, which they had so rashly embraced. But their Teachers and
Leaders kept out of the Way: they were unwilling to enter the Lists
with Men, whom Heaven had endowed with such miraculous Powers.
However, as the Whole of their Cause was now at stake, they agreed,
at last, to meet the Two Prelates, and met them accordingly. But
this Meeting proved fatal to the <i>Pelagian</i> Cause; for the <i>Pelagians</i>
declining to undertake the Cure of a blind Girl that was presented to
them, St. <i>Germanus</i>, by applying to her Eyes some Reliques, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>he always carried about with him, cured her at once of her Blindness,
and with her the whole Island<a id='r1609' /><a href='#f1609' class='c015'><sup>[1609]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The whole Island reclaimed.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But these Miracles were soon
forgotten: according to the same Author, the <i>Pelagian</i> Heresy took
root again, and new Miracles were wanted to check its Growth.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Germanus <i>returns anew, and utterly roots out the</i> Pelagian <i>Heresy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Germanus</i> therefore, in the Year 447. returned to <i>Britain</i>; exerted

<div class='sidenote'><i>Beginning of the Dis-<br/>pute between</i> Nestor-<br/>ius <i>and St.</i> Cyril.</div>

<p class='c001'>The following Year, 430. is one of the most remarkable Years in
the Annals of the Church. For it was in that Year that the famous
Dispute began between <i>Nestorius</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, and St.
<i>Cyril</i> Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, which rent the whole Church into Two
opposite and irreconcileable Factions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>What occasioned this Dispute.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  What gave Occasion to that
Dispute was, the Title of <i>Mother of God</i>, which began at this time
to be commonly given to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>. Such a Title <i>Nestorius</i>
thought very improper, derogatory to the Majesty of the Eternal
Creator, and only calculated to lead the Unwary into gross Mistakes
concerning the Mystery of the Incarnation, and the Nature of Christ.
For he argued, that it could not be said, without a kind of Blasphemy,
that <i>God was born of a Woman</i>, that <i>God had suffered</i>, that <i>God had
died</i>, nor, consequently, that <i>the Virgin</i> Mary <i>was the Mother of God.
We must not imagine</i>, said he, <i>that God, or the Word, was born of the
Virgin</i> Mary; <i>but we ought to believe, that God, or the Word, was
united to him, who was born of the Virgin</i> Mary<a id='r1611' /><a href='#f1611' class='c015'><sup>[1611]</sup></a>. The Title of <i>Mother
of Christ</i> was that which he thought should be given to the Virgin, as
containing all that was meant by the other, without the Impropriety
and Offence of the Expression, and without Danger of confounding the
Divine Nature of Christ with the Human. This Doctrine was received,
and maintained with great Warmth by some, both Ecclesiastics and
Laymen, and with no less Warmth opposed by others. The latter
thought it was calling in question the Divinity of Christ, and degrading
the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, to rob her of the glorious Title of the <i>Mother of
God</i>; and her Glory was now become one of their highest Concerns.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Characters of</i> Cyril <i>and</i> Nestorius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  At the Head of these was St. <i>Cyril</i>, a Man of a most haughty and
imperious Temper, impatient of Contradiction, obstinately wedded
to his own Opinion, passionate, revengeful, and more eagerly bent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>at least in the present Dispute, upon conquering his Adversary, than
discovering the Truth. In some of there Qualities he was well matched
by <i>Nestorius</i>; but the latter was not so eager for Victory, so tenacious
of his own Opinion, or rather of his own Terms (for the whole
Dispute was about Terms), as not to be ready to explain them; which
had he been allowed to do, an End had been put at once to the Quarrel.
But <i>Cyril</i> would hearken to no Explanations. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cyril <i>will not allow</i> Nestorius <i>to explain his Meaning. He defames him, and writes against him to the Emperor.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He peremptorily
required <i>Nestorius</i> to acknowlege and confess the Virgin <i>Mary</i> to be
the <i>Mother of God</i>, without any Distinction or Explanation; and because
he would not comply, he defamed him all over the East, as a
Reviver of the Heresy of <i>Paul</i> of <i>Samosata</i>, denying the real Union
between the Human and the Divine Nature in the Person of Christ;
stirred up the People of <i>Constantinople</i>, his own Flock, against him;
and spared no Pains to discredit him with the Emperor, and other great
Persons at Court. For he writ Three Letters to Court; one to the
Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, to his Wife <i>Eudoxia</i>, and to his Sister <i>Pulcheria</i>;
another <i>to the Queen’s Virgins, and Brides of Christ</i>, that is, to
<i>Pulcheria</i> and her Sisters; and a third <i>to the Empresses</i>, that is, to
<i>Eudoxia</i> and <i>Pulcheria</i>. The Purport of these Letters was to prove,
that the Virgin <i>Mary</i> was, and ought to be styled, the <i>Mother of
God</i>; that to dispute such a Title was rank Heresy; and that whoever
disputed it was unworthy of the Protection of the Imperial Family.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Nestorius</i>, being now sensible, that <i>Cyril</i> was determined to keep no
Measures with him, resolved, in his Turn, to keep none with one,
who had given him so great Provocation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nestorius <i>excommunicates and deposes those who side with</i> Cyril. <i>Causes some of them to be imprisoned and whipt.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He therefore assembled a
Council at <i>Constantinople</i>, and there, with the unanimous Consent of
the Bishops, who composed it, he solemnly excommunicated the Laymen,
and deposed the Ecclesiastics, who rejected his Doctrine<a id='r1612' /><a href='#f1612' class='c015'><sup>[1612]</sup></a>. He
did not stop here; but caused several Ecclesiastics, Monks, and Laymen,
the Friends of <i>Cyril</i>, to be apprehended, to be dragged to the
public Prison, and to be there whipt very severely, as Disturbers of the
public Peace, and Sowers of Heresy and Sedition. What chiefly provoked
him, was a Paper posted up in a public Place of the City, declaring
him a Heretic, and guilty of the Heresy formerly held by <i>Paul</i>
of <i>Samosata</i>, denying a true Union between the Word and the Humanity
in the Person of Christ; which was one of the many Calumnies
broached against him by <i>Cyril</i> to blacken his Reputation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>Thus were the Christians in the East divided into two opposite Parties,
irreconcileably incensed against each other, and reviling each
other with all the opprobrious Names Malice and Rage could suggest.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nestorius <i>strives to gain</i> Celestine <i>and the Western Bishops</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  But <i>Cyril</i>’s Party was by far the most numerous and powerful. <i>Nestorius</i>
therefore, having strove in vain to strengthen his Party in the East,
resolved in the End to try the West, being well apprised, that the
Authority of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, and the other Western Bishops,
would be abundantly sufficient to turn the Scale. He therefore writ
a long Letter to <i>Celestine</i>, acquainting him with what had passed in
the East, and explaining, without the least Disguise or Equivocation,
the Doctrine he held; nay, he sent him all the Homilies, which he
had preached on that Subject. In this Letter he owns his irreconcileable
Aversion to the Words <i>Mother of God</i>, as raising Ideas, especially
in the Minds of the Vulgar, inconsistent with the Majesty of the Supreme
Being. He adds, that by disputing the Title of <i>Mother of God</i>,
he only meant, that the Word was not born of the Virgin <i>Mary</i><a id='r1613' /><a href='#f1613' class='c015'><sup>[1613]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cyril <i>writes to</i><br/>Celestine, <i>and sends<br/>him the Homilies of</i><br/>Nestorius, <i>with<br/>his own Comments upon<br/>them</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>St. <i>Cyril</i>, being informed that <i>Nestorius</i> had written to <i>Celestine</i>,
summoned a Council at <i>Alexandria</i>; and, by their Advice, writ the
famous Letter to <i>Celestine</i>, which has reached our Times. In that
Letter he acquaints him with the State of Affairs in the East, and the
Disturbances raised there by <i>Nestorius</i>, as if himself had been no-ways
concerned in them; tells him that it is absolutely necessary, that all
the Bishops of the Church should unite as one Man against that Prelate;
that the Bishops in the East are well disposed to join in the common
Cause; and that they only waited to know from him, whether they
were to communicate with <i>Nestorius</i>, or openly renounce his Communion.
At the same time <i>Cyril</i> sent to <i>Rome</i> the Homilies of <i>Nestorius</i>,
the Letters which he had written to him, his Answers, and
with them a Writing containing the Sentiments of the Fathers concerning
the Mystery of the Incarnation. For the Gospel, the <i>Testimony
of Christ</i>, was already laid aside, and the Testimony of Men
taken, in most Disputes, for the Rule and Standard of the Christian
Belief. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Popish Writers have no Occasion to boast of the Recourse had by</i> Cyril <i>to</i> Celestine.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The <i>Roman Catholics</i> have no Reason to boast, as they do,
of the Recourse had by St. <i>Cyril</i> on this Occasion to the Pope. For
<i>Posidonius</i>, one of <i>Cyril</i>’s Deacons, who was dispatched with the
above-mentioned Papers to <i>Rome</i>, was directed, in his private Instructions,
not to deliver them, but to bring them back to <i>Alexandria</i>, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>he found that <i>Nestorius</i> had not applied to <i>Celestine</i><a id='r1614' /><a href='#f1614' class='c015'><sup>[1614]</sup></a>; so that if <i>Nestorius</i>
had not recurred to the Pope, <i>Cyril</i> never would. <i>Posidonius</i>
found, upon Inquiry, that <i>Nestorius</i> had written to <i>Celestine</i>; and therefore
delivered to him, pursuant to his Instructions, all the Papers
with which he was charged. <i>Cyril</i> writ in <i>Latin</i>, and even caused
the Homilies of <i>Nestorius</i> to be translated into that Language, with
his own Comments upon them; whereas <i>Nestorius</i> had sent them in
the original <i>Greek</i>, and writ his Letters in the same Tongue; which
had obliged <i>Celestine</i> to send them into <i>Gaul</i>, to be translated there
by the famous <i>Cassian</i>, who was a Native of <i>Thrace</i>, and lived then
at <i>Marseilles</i>, there being none, it seems, in <i>Rome</i> or <i>Italy</i>, sufficiently
qualified for that Task. <i>Cyril</i> having thus got the Start of his Antagonist,
though he writ the last, <i>Celestine</i> was, by his Writings,
prejudiced to such a Degree against <i>Nestorius</i>, before he had heard
what he had to offer in his Defence, that all he did or could offer
afterwards availed him nothing. <i>Celestine</i> indeed perused all his Papers
as soon as they were translated and sent back from <i>Gaul</i>, but perused
them with the strong Prejudices which he had imbibed from the
Writings of <i>Cyril</i>; so that he discovered in each Homily, nay, in
every Line, <i>Heresies</i>, <i>Impieties</i>, and <i>Blasphemies</i>, not to be uttered
or heard.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nestorius <i>condemned<br/>by a Council held at</i><br/>Rome.</div>

<p class='c001'>A Council was therefore assembled at <i>Rome</i>, to condemn, rather
than to examine, the <i>new Doctrine</i>. At this Council assisted most
of the Western Bishops<a id='r1615' /><a href='#f1615' class='c015'><sup>[1615]</sup></a>; <i>Celestine</i> presided; the Homilies were read,
and with them the Letters both of <i>Cyril</i> and <i>Nestorius</i>. <i>Celestine</i>
made a long Speech, to prove not only by the Passages which <i>Cyril</i>
had suggested to him out of the Fathers, but by others from St. <i>Hilarius</i>,
from Pope <i>Damasus</i>, and from a Hymn which St. <i>Ambrose</i> had
caused to be yearly sung by his People on <i>Christmas-Day</i>, that <i>the
Virgin</i> Mary <i>was truly the Mother of God</i><a id='r1616' /><a href='#f1616' class='c015'><sup>[1616]</sup></a>. When he had done,
<i>Nestorius</i> was declared the Author of a <i>new and very dangerous Heresy</i>,
<i>Cyril</i> was highly extolled for opposing it, his Doctrine was applauded
by all as strictly orthodox, and Sentence of Deposition pronounced
against such Ecclesiastics as should refuse to sign it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Celestine <i>acquaints</i><br/>Nestorius <i>with<br/>the Judgment of the<br/>Western Bishops</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Before the Council broke up, <i>Celestine</i> writ to <i>Nestorius</i>, acquainting
him with the judgment of the Western Bishops upon this Dispute;
and at the same time warning him, that if, in the Term of Ten Days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>after the Receipt of that Letter, he did not publicly condemn the
Doctrine which he had hitherto taught, and teach the Doctrine which
he had hitherto condemned, he should be deposed without any further
Delay, and cut off from the Communion of the Church<a id='r1617' /><a href='#f1617' class='c015'><sup>[1617]</sup></a>. This
Letter is dated the 11th of <i>August</i> of this Year 430. He writ several
other Letters, all bearing the same Date, <i>viz.</i> one to <i>Cyril</i>; one to the
Clergy, Monks, and People of <i>Constantinople</i>; one to each of the
Bishops of the chief Sees; and one to the Church of <i>Antioch</i>. All
these Letters were to the same Effect, <i>viz.</i> to acquaint those, to whom
they were addressed, with the Sentence pronounced by the Council
of <i>Rome</i> against <i>Nestorius</i>, and encourage them to be assisting
in the Execution of it. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Celestine <i>appoints</i> Cyril <i>his Vicegerent</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  His Letter to <i>Cyril</i> deserves particular Notice:
for he there appoints him to act in the present Affair, that is,
in excommunicating and deposing <i>Nestorius</i>, as <i>his Vicegerent, in
the Name, and with the Authority, of his See</i><a id='r1618' /><a href='#f1618' class='c015'><sup>[1618]</sup></a>. It must be observed
here, that the Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, neither alone, nor jointly with the
whole Body of the Western Bishops, had, or even claimed at this
time, the Power of deposing the Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, or indeed
any other Bishop in the East, without the Consent and Concurrence of
the Eastern Bishops. This <i>Cyril</i> well knew; and therefore, lest <i>Celestine</i>
should, on that Consideration, decline giving Judgment against
<i>Nestorius</i>, he made him believe, that the Eastern Bishops were all disposed
to join against the pretended Heresiarch; that they waited only
his Determination, and were ready to concur, to a Man, in executing
the Judgment which he should give. This was making <i>Celestine</i> believe,
that the Eastern Bishops had chosen him for their Judge in the
present Dispute, and agreed to acquiesce in his Decision. It was upon
this Presumption that <i>Celestine</i> pronounced the above-mentioned Sentence
against <i>Nestorius</i>, and appointed <i>Cyril</i> to act in his room, with
the Authority which he falsely supposed to have been granted him on
this Occasion. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is imposed upon by</i> Cyril.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  I say, <i>falsely</i>; for what <i>Cyril</i> writ to him was absolutely
false, <i>viz.</i> that all the Bishops in the East were ready to join
him against <i>Nestorius</i>, and concur in executing the Sentence which he
should pronounce. Several Bishops had declared for <i>Nestorius</i>, and
not one, that we know of, against him, at the time <i>Cyril</i> writ, besides
<i>Cyril</i> himself, and the other <i>Egyptian</i> Bishops, who were intirely
governed by him; nay, the Sentence pronounced at <i>Rome</i> was Matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>of great Surprize to all, but more especially to <i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, and
<i>Juvenal</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, who could not help censuring, with some
Sharpness, the Western Bishops, as acting rashly in an Affair that required
the most mature Deliberation. But <i>Cyril</i> was chiefly to blame,
who, to engage the Western Bishops on his Side, and by their means
compass the Ruin of his Antagonist, had represented the State of Affairs
very differently from what it really was.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was doubtless a very extraordinary Thing for a Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>
to accept the Commission of Vicegerent or Deputy to the Bishop
of <i>Rome</i>; and <i>Celestine</i> would hardly have thought of offering
him such a Commission, if he had not been sensible that, from the
Heat of his Passion upon this Occasion, he would be willing to act in
any Capacity, that would impower him to hurt his Antagonist. So
ably did the Popes, from the earliest times, avail themselves of every
Circumstance that could give them the Means to promote and extend
their Jurisdiction!</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cyril <i>sends</i><br/>Celestine<i>’s Letter<br/>to</i> Nestorius;</div>

<p class='c001'>The above-mentioned Letters from <i>Celestine</i> were all sent to <i>Cyril</i>,
who was to convey them to those they were addressed to; which he
did accordingly, accompanying them with Letters of his own, all calculated
to inflame his Collegues and the rest of the Clergy, as well as
the Laity, against <i>Nestorius</i>, as an Enemy to <i>the Mother of God</i> and
the Catholic Church. As for the Letter to <i>Nestorius</i> himself, he dispatched
Four Bishops with it to <i>Constantinople</i>, who chose to deliver
it to him while he was assisting at Divine Service, in the great Church,
with his Clergy, and many Persons of Distinction belonging to the
Court. His View in this was to render their Legation the more solemn,
and thereby alarm the Populace, who hitherto had taken no
Part in the Quarrel. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and requires him to retract his pretended Errors, on pain of being deposed.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  With <i>Celestine</i>’s Letter they delivered to him
one from <i>Cyril</i>, peremptorily requiring him to retract his Errors, to
confirm his Retractation with a solemn Oath, and publicly to anathematize
Twelve Propositions contained in the Letter. and extracted out
of his Works. <i>Cyril</i> let him know, that if he did not comply with his
Demand, before the time prefixed by <i>Celestine</i> was expired, he would
take care to have the Sentence of the Western Bishops executed with
the utmost Rigour and Severity. <i>Nestorius</i> received the Letters, and
desired the Legates to meet him the next Day at his own House; but
when they came, he did not admit them; nor did he return any
Answer either to <i>Celestine</i> or <i>Cyril</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nestorius <i>inclined to yield for the sake of Peace</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  However, in a Sermon which he
preached Six Days after, that is, on <i>Saturday</i> the 13th of <i>December</i>, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>declared, that, to maintain the Peace and Tranquillity of the Church,
to put an End to the present Dispute, which might be attended with
greater Evils than his Enemies seemed to be aware of, he was ready to
grant the Title of <i>Mother of God</i> to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, <i>provided nothing
else was thereby meant</i>; but that <i>the Man born of her was united
to the Divinity</i><a id='r1619' /><a href='#f1619' class='c015'><sup>[1619]</sup></a>. This Sermon, and another which he preached the
next Day, the 14th of <i>December</i>, on the same Subject, he sent to
<i>John</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, one of the most eminent Prelates both for
Piety and Learning at that time in the Church. <i>John</i> perused them
with great Attention, and finding nothing in them that was not, in
his Opinion, intirely agreeable to the Catholic Doctrine, he concluded
the present Dispute to be happily ended. But <i>Cyril</i> was not yet
satisfied; he peremptorily required <i>Nestorius</i> to anathematize the
Twelve Propositions which I have mentioned above; and to anathematize
them was, in the Opinion of the Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, and of
almost all the Bishops of his Patriarchate, anathematizing the Doctrine
of the Church, and approving that of the <i>Apollinarists</i>, which had
been condemned by the Church. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Doctrine of</i> Cyril <i>judged impious by the Orientals</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For <i>Cyril</i>, in combating the Distinction
maintained by <i>Nestorius</i> between the Two Natures in Christ,
seemed to have run headlong into the opposite Doctrine confounding
the Two Natures; insomuch that <i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i> thought himself
not only obliged to warn his Collegues in the East, by a circular Letter,
against such <i>impious Doctrines</i>, but to cause them to be confuted in
Writing, by Two of the most learned Prelates of his Patriarchate<a id='r1620' /><a href='#f1620' class='c015'><sup>[1620]</sup></a>.
They were answered by <i>Cyril</i>, incapable of yielding, or ever giving up
a Cause, which he had once undertaken to defend. Thus a new
Quarrel broke out between <i>Cyril</i> and the Bishops of the Patriarchate
of <i>Antioch</i>, of which it is foreign to my Purpose to give here an
Account.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>An Oecumenical Council<br/>summoned by the Emperor<br/>to meet at</i> Ephesus.</div>

<p class='c001'><i>Nestorius</i>, foreseeing the Storm that the Dispute between him and
<i>Cyril</i> was likely to raise in the Church, had, in order to prevent it,
applied to the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i> for the assembling an Oecumenical
Council, even before he received the Letters of <i>Celestine</i> and <i>Cyril</i>,
which I have mentioned above; and, upon his Application, the Emperor
had summoned a Council to meet at <i>Ephesus</i> by <i>Whitsuntide</i> of
the following Year 431. The Letter, which <i>Theodosius</i> writ on that
Occasion, was dated the 19th of <i>November</i> 430. and addressed to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>the Metropolitans, who were thereby injoined to attend at the Place
and Time appointed, and bring with them such of their Suffragans as
might be well spared from the Service of the Churches in their respective
Provinces. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Letter to</i> Cyril.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  Besides the circular Letter to all Metropolitans in
common, <i>Theodosius</i> writ to <i>Cyril</i> in particular, to let him know
that he looked upon him as the sole Author of the present Disturbances,
and therefore expected that he would not fail to attend the Council at
the time appointed; that from him he would admit of no Excuse;
that his punctual Compliance with the present Order was the only
means of regaining his Favour, and inclining him to think that it was
not any private Pique, or Animosity, but a Persuasion that he was defending
the Truth, which had prompted him to act, as he had hitherto
done, so contrary to all the Rules of Modesty and Discretion. In
the same Letter he reproaches <i>Cyril</i>, and in the sharpest Terms, with
Pride, Arrogance, and Presumption; and even charges him with
having attempted to sow Divisions in the Imperial Family. But this
Charge was groundless, having no other Foundation, but <i>Cyril</i>’s
having written apart to <i>Pulcheria</i> and her Sisters, which the Emperor
supposed to have been done with a Design to raise a Misunderstanding
between him and them<a id='r1621' /><a href='#f1621' class='c015'><sup>[1621]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Irregular Proceedings<br/>of the Council.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Council met at the Time and Place appointed, pursuant to the
Emperor’s Orders. But every thing was transacted in that Assembly
so contrary to all the Rules of Justice, and even of Decency, with so
much Prejudice and Animosity, that they seemed to be all actuated by
the Spirit of <i>Cyril</i>, and to have met with no other View than to gratify
his private Passion and Revenge. <i>Cyril</i> presided, who was the Party
concerned, and the avowed Enemy of <i>Nestorius</i>. They began their
Sessions before the Arrival of <i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i>, and the Bishops of
that Patriarchate, who were supposed to favour <i>Nestorius</i>, though
they had certain Intelligence of their being within a sew Days Journey
of <i>Ephesus</i>; nay, they would not even wait for the Pope’s Legates,
and a good Number of Bishops who were coming from <i>Italy</i>,
and the Island of <i>Sicily</i>. <i>Nestorius</i>, and Count <i>Candidianus</i>, whom
the Emperor had sent to assist at the Council in his Name, earnestly begged
them to put off the Sessions only for Four Days longer, assuring
them that <i>John</i> and his Suffragans would reach <i>Ephesus</i> within that
Time. But all in vain: they were determined to condemn <i>Nestorius</i>,
right or wrong; and therefore could by no means be prevailed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>to wait the Arrival of those who, they apprehended, would oppose,
and perhaps might intirely defeat the End for which alone they seemed
to believe they had been assembled. <i>Nestorius</i> was summoned to appear
the very next Day, and clear himself before the Council of the
impious Doctrine with which he was charged. He refused to comply
till the Orientals, that is, those of the Patriarchate of <i>Antioch</i>, were
arrived; and, upon that Refusal, the Council met very early next
Morning, read all his Letters and Homilies, condemned the Doctrine
they contained, approved the Doctrine of <i>Cyril</i>, whose Letters were
likewise read; and closed this very remarkable Session with pronouncing
Sentence of Deposition and Excommunication against <i>Nestorius</i>,
in the following Terms; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Sentence they pronounced against</i> Nestorius.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Our Lord Jesus Christ, against whom
the most wicked</i> Nestorius <i>has leveled his Blasphemies, declares him,
by the Mouth of this Council, deprived of the Episcopal Dignity,
and cut off from the Communion of the Episcopal Order</i><a id='r1622' /><a href='#f1622' class='c015'><sup>[1622]</sup></a>. This
Sentence was signed by all the Bishops who were present, pasted up in
the most public Places of <i>Ephesus</i>, and notified to all the Inhabitants
by the Criers of the City. It was no sooner known than the whole
City resounded with loud Shouts of Joy, the Streets were illuminated,
and the People, crouding to the Church where the Council was held,
attended the Bishops, with lighted Torches in their Hands, and great
Acclamations, to their respective Habitations, the Women walking
before them, and burning Perfumes<a id='r1623' /><a href='#f1623' class='c015'><sup>[1623]</sup></a>. It had been as dangerous for
<i>Nestorius</i> to shew himself in <i>Ephesus</i>, at this Juncture, as it was formerly
for St. <i>Paul</i>, the <i>Ephesians</i> being no less devoted now to the
Virgin <i>Mary</i> than they were in the Apostle’s Time to their great <i>Diana</i>,
and their Superstition no less mischievous, though the Object was
changed. The Virgin <i>Mary</i> was the Patroness of <i>Ephesus</i>, the <i>Ephesians</i>
believing then that they possessed her Body. But it is now believed
by the Church of <i>Rome</i>, that she was taken up Soul and Body
into Heaven, and the Festival of her <i>Assumption</i> is kept with great Solemnity
on the 15th of <i>August</i>, being preceded by a Vigil or Fast.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>In what terms they acquainted</i> Nestorius <i>with the Sentence pronounced against him</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Council took care to acquaint <i>Nestorius</i> with the Sentence which
they had pronounced against him; and the Note, which they writ
to him on that Occasion, shews but too plainly, that they were swayed
in all they did by Passion alone. For the Note was thus directed; <i>To</i>
Nestorius <i>a second</i> Judas<a id='r1624' /><a href='#f1624' class='c015'><sup>[1624]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Such is the Account which the Antients give us of the First Oecumenical
Council of <i>Ephesus</i>, one of the Four, which <i>Gregory the
Great</i> received with as much Veneration as the Four Gospels<a id='r1625' /><a href='#f1625' class='c015'><sup>[1625]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council of</i> Ephesus <i>unworthy of that Name</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> But
notwithstanding his Authority, we may, perhaps, with more Truth,
apply to this Council than to any other what <i>Nazianzen</i> writ of the
Councils of his Time; <i>viz.</i> that <i>he had never seen an Assembly of
Bishops that ended well</i>; that, <i>by assembling, they had always heightened
rather than cured the Evil</i>; that <i>in such Assemblies, Passion,
Jealousy, Prejudice, Envy, the Desire of Victory generally prevailed</i>;
and that <i>those who took upon them to judge others, were, generally
speaking, swayed by some private Grudge, their Zeal being owing
more to the Ill-will which they bore to the Criminals, than the
Aversion which they had to their Crimes</i><a id='r1626' /><a href='#f1626' class='c015'><sup>[1626]</sup></a>. As to the present Assembly,
it may be justly questioned whether it deserves the Name of
a Council, or ought not rather to be styled a seditious and tumultuary
Conventicle of Men, assembled with no other View but to revenge
the private Quarrel of their Head and Leader. For they met against
the Will of the Imperial Commissioner Count <i>Candidianus</i>, who represented
the Person of the Emperor; nay, upon his acquainting
them, that it was the Will of the Emperor they should wait the Arrival
of the Oriental and Western Bishops, they drove him by Force
out of the Assembly. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Is protested against by the Imperial Commissioner and Seventy-six Bishops.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> <i>Candidianus</i>, seeing the Emperor’s Orders thus
trampled under foot by the riotous Bishops, entered a Protest
against their Proceedings, and declared them null. This Protest was
addressed, <i>To</i> Cyril, <i>and the Bishops assembled with him</i><a id='r1627' /><a href='#f1627' class='c015'><sup>[1627]</sup></a>. <i>Nestorius</i>
likewise, Seven Bishops who were assembled with him, and Sixty-eight
more, all protested against the Meeting of the Council till the
Arrival of the Orientals: so that Seventy-six Bishops, who were then
actually in <i>Ephesus</i>, protested against, and absented themselves from
the Council. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They act contrary to all Rules of Justice and Religion.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As therefore neither the Orientals, nor the Western
Bishops, were yet come, the Assembly was composed only of <i>Egyptians</i>
and <i>Asiatics</i>, who were intirely devoted to <i>Cyril</i>. But how irregular
soever their Meeting was, their Method of acting, after they
met, was no less irregular. <i>Cyril</i>, who was the Party concerned, and
the avowed Enemy of <i>Nestorius</i>, received the Depositions against him,
examined the Witnesses, gave what Explication he pleased to his Words,
and delivered his Opinion the first; which was acting in open Contradiction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>to the known Laws of Justice and Religion. In the first
Session several Things were transacted, that might have given full
Employment for several Sessions. How could they examine, in so
short a time, the Twelve Propositions which <i>Cyril</i> required <i>Nestorius</i>
to anathematize, Propositions that were capable of so many
different Interpretations, that were afterwards so differently interpreted,
and occasioned endless Quarrels and Disputes, some admitting them
as Catholic, and rejecting the opposite Propositions as heretical; others
admitting the opposite Propositions as Catholic, and rejecting them as heretical,
without being able to agree in any thing else but in anathematizing
and cursing each other? How could they compare the many Passages
out of the Homilies of <i>Nestorius</i>, with the different Contexts, in
order to find out his true Meaning? To examine so many different
Propositions, all relating to a Subject above our Comprehension, and
in Terms hardly intelligible to the most speculative Understanding, to
declare which were Heterodox, and which Orthodox, which were
agreeable, and which disagreeable, to the Doctrine of the Fathers (for
the Scripture was out of the Question), and all this in a few Hours,
was, it must be owned, a most wondrous Performance. But the
Orientals were at hand: <i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i> was a Man of great Credit:
it was apprehended, that the many Bishops, who were then in <i>Ephesus</i>,
and had absented themselves from the Council, might join him, and
he <i>Nestorius</i>. Dispatch was therefore to be used, and the Business of
many Sessions transacted in one, that <i>Cyril</i> might have his full Revenge
before their Arrival.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Conduct of</i> Cyril<br/><i>sharply censured by<br/>his greatest Friends</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in this Light that the Conduct of <i>Cyril</i> and the other Bishops
appeared to St. <i>Isidore</i> of <i>Pelusium</i>, a Prelate of great Learning and
Sagacity, and one who professed a particular Friendship for <i>Cyril</i>.
For, being informed of what had passed at <i>Ephesus</i>, he was so shocked
at the Conduct of his Friend, that he could not help censuring it with
great Severity. <i>Your Conduct</i>, said he, in a private Letter to him,
<i>and the Tragedy which you have lately acted at</i> Ephesus, <i>are Matter
of great Surprise to some, and Diversion to others. It is publicly
said, that you sought only to be revenged on your Enemies, and that
you have therein imitated your Uncle</i> Theophilus; <i>and, indeed,
though the Persons accused may be different, the Conduct of the Accusers
is the same. You had better have continued quiet, than revenged
your private Injuries at the Expence of the public Peace, and
Tranquillity of the Church, by sowing Dissensions among her Members,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>under the Colour of Piety and Religion</i><a id='r1628' /><a href='#f1628' class='c015'><sup>[1628]</sup></a>. <i>Theophilus</i>, whom <i>Isidore</i>
mentions in his Letter, was Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, Uncle to
<i>Cyril</i>, and at the Head of the Faction that deposed <i>Chrysostom</i><a id='r1629' /><a href='#f1629' class='c015'><sup>[1629]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Orientals arrive.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Five Days after the Deposition of <i>Nestorius</i>, <i>John</i> of <i>Antioch</i> and
the Orientals arrived; and great was their Surprize, when they were
informed by Count <i>Candidianus</i>, who came to wait on them, of
what had passed. <i>John</i> had always advised <i>Nestorius</i> to allow the
Title of <i>Mother of God</i> to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, for the sake of Peace;
but could not think him an Heretic for disputing it. But, as to the
Doctrine of <i>Cyril</i>, he looked upon it as rank <i>Apollinarism</i>; and, as
such, had caused it to be confuted. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>They insist upon the Points that had been so hastily decided, to be examined anew. Which being refused by</i> Cyril, <i>they assemble apart</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> No wonder, therefore, if, upon
hearing that the Doctrine of <i>Cyril</i> had been declared Catholic, that
the Doctrine of <i>Nestorius</i> had been condemned as Heretical, and
he excommunicated and deposed for holding it, he insisted, as he did,
upon their agreeing to have those Points examined anew, and more
maturely, before he would assist at the Council. This Demand he
thought the more reasonable, as <i>Cyril</i> had assured him, by a Letter
dated but Two Days before the Meeting of the Council, that
they should not meet till his Arrival. But <i>Cyril</i>, as we may well
imagine, would by no means consent to it; which so provoked
<i>John</i>, that, after several expostulatory Letters between him and <i>Cyril</i>,
he assembled, at last, his Orientals apart, and, with them, such
as adhered to him, about Fifty in all. In this new Council, the Proceedings
of the other were examined; and, being found repugnant
to the Canons, and owing merely to Rancour and Passion, they
were, by the whole Assembly, with one Voice, declared null. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Two Councils<br/>anathematize and<br/>excommunicate one<br/>another.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The
Orientals did not stop here; but, after a strict Examination of the
Doctrine of <i>Cyril</i>, they declared it Heretical; and, in virtue of that
Declaration, pronounced Sentence of Excommunication and Deposition
against him, against <i>Memnon</i> Bishop of <i>Ephesus</i>, a zealous
Stickler for his Doctrine, and against all the Bishops who should communicate
with either, till they had publicly retracted their Errors.
The Blow was soon returned by <i>Cyril</i>, and those who sided with him;
the Orientals were all declared <i>Nestorians</i>, and, with <i>Nestorius</i>, deposed,
excommunicated, anathematized. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Both recur to<br/>the Emperor.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  War being thus declared
between the Two Councils, Expresses were immediately dispatched,
by both, to the Emperor, and their Friends at Court; for they were
both sensible, that the Doctrine of those, who had most Friends there,
would, in the End, prove the most Orthodox. The Emperor read,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>with great Attention, the Accounts transmitted to him by both Parties,
and would have approved and confirmed the Proceedings of the
Orientals, had he not been diverted from it, first by his Physician
named <i>John</i>, and afterwards by <i>Acacius</i> Bishop of <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, who happened
to be then at Court. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He approves the<br/>Deposition of</i> Nest-<br/>orius, Cyril, <i>and</i><br/>Memnon.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For the present <i>Theodosius</i> contented himself
with approving the Deposition of <i>Nestorius</i>, of <i>Cyril</i>, and of <i>Memnon</i>,
who, he said, well deserved such a Punishment, as being the
chief Authors of the present Disturbances; <i>for, as to their Faith</i>,
he added, <i>I believe they are all Three alike Orthodox</i>. Which was
true; and more than both Councils had been able to find out.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>All three arrested<br/>by the Emperor’s Order,<br/>who endeavours, in<br/>vain, to reconcile<br/>the Bishops</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor, having taken this Resolution, dispatched Count
<i>John</i> to <i>Ephesus</i>, with Orders to drive the Three Incendiaries, <i>Nestorius</i>,
<i>Cyril</i>, and <i>Memnon</i>, out of the City, and persuade the Bishops
to assemble in One Council. Count <i>John</i>, soon after his Arrival,
caused the Three Bishops to be arrested and confined; but
could by no means bring about an Accommodation between the
Two Parties; the Orientals obstinately refusing to communicate with
the Friends of <i>Cyril</i>, till they had anathematized his Doctrine; and
his Friends no less obstinately requiring the Orientals to anathematize
the Doctrine of <i>Nestorius</i>, before they would communicate with
them; so that <i>John</i> was obliged in the End, notwithstanding all the
Pains he took, to acquaint the Emperor, that he had found the
Minds of the Bishops so soured and exasperated against one another,
that it was impossible ever to reconcile them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He orders both<br/>Councils to send a<br/>certain Number of<br/>Deputies to</i> Con-<br/>stantinople.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The Emperor, upon
the Receipt of his Letter, dispatched an Order to both Councils, injoining
them to send a certain Number of Deputies, both the same
Number, to <i>Constantinople</i>, where he proposed to have the Points in
Dispute impartially examined. In Compliance with this Order, the
Two Councils sent each Eight Deputies, who immediately set out, with
proper Instructions, for <i>Constantinople</i>; but, arriving at <i>Chalcedon</i>, on
the opposite Side of the <i>Bosporus</i>, they were stopped there, by an Order
from the Emperor, it not being thought safe for the Orientals to
enter <i>Constantinople</i>, the Monks, who were very numerous in that
City, having prejudiced the Populace against them. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He hears them at</i> Chalcedon.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  They arrived at
<i>Chalcedon</i> in the latter End of <i>August</i>; and, on the 4th of <i>September</i>,
the Emperor came to the Palace of <i>Ruffinus</i>, in that Neighbourhood,
and there heard both Parties, with great Patience. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Is, at first, favourable<br/>to the Orientals and</i><br/>Nestorius; <i>but after-<br/>wards declares<br/>against them</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> He was, at first, so
favourable to the Orientals, that they thought themselves sure of
Victory; and even writ to their Friends at <i>Ephesus</i>, desiring them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>to thank him for the Kindness he had shewn them. But, to their
great Surprize, the Face of Affairs changed at once. They had been
already admitted Four times to the Emperor’s Presence, and heard
by him with much Kindness: but, in the Fifth Audience, which they
thought would complete their Triumph, the Emperor, after receiving
them with great Coolness, told them, abruptly, that they had better
admit both <i>Memnon</i> and <i>Cyril</i> to their Communion, and abandon the
Defence of <i>Nestorius</i>. They were thunderstruck with such a Proposal,
and strongly remonstrated against it. But <i>Theodosius</i>, deaf to
their Remonstrances, returned the next Day to <i>Constantinople</i>, carrying
with him the Deputies of the adverse Party, in order to have a
new Bishop ordained by them, in the room of <i>Nestorius</i>. Soon after
his Return, he issued an Edict, declaring <i>Nestorius</i> justly deposed,
reinstating <i>Cyril</i> and <i>Memnon</i> in their Sees, and giving all the other
Bishops Leave to return to their respective Churches, they being all
alike Orthodox<a id='r1630' /><a href='#f1630' class='c015'><sup>[1630]</sup></a>. This was declaring the Council dissolved; and it
was dissolved accordingly; but the Disturbances which it occasioned,
were not composed till many Years after.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>To what this Change<br/>was owing</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>The sudden Change in the Emperor, with respect to the Orientals,
is ascribed by <i>Acacius</i> Bishop of <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>, to the Gold that <i>Cyril</i>
caused to be prodigally distributed, on this Occasion, among the
Courtiers. For <i>Acacius</i> writes, that one of the Eunuchs of the
Court, by Name <i>Scholasticus</i>, dying possessed of great Wealth, the
Emperor found a Note among his Papers, acknowleging the Receipt
of large Sums remitted to him by <i>Paul</i>, <i>Cyril</i>’s Nephew, in <i>Cyril</i>’s
Name<a id='r1631' /><a href='#f1631' class='c015'><sup>[1631]</sup></a>. It is true, we are not bound to give Credit to <i>Acacius</i>, as
<i>Du Pin</i> observes. But in what other Manner can we account for
so sudden a Change, for such an inconsistent Method of acting? The
Emperor thinks both Parties equally Orthodox, and yet declares <i>Nestorius</i>
justly deposed, and restores <i>Cyril</i> and <i>Memnon</i> to their Sees;
and that soon after he had appeared more favourable to the Friends
of <i>Nestorius</i> than to those of <i>Cyril</i>. To what else could this be owing,
if it was not the Effect of Bribery?</p>

<p class='c001'>The Pope’s Legates, <i>viz.</i> <i>Arcadius</i>, <i>Projectus</i>, and <i>Philippus</i>, the
two former Bishops, and the latter a Presbyter, did not arrive at

Proof, that he did not preside as the Pope’s Legate; for if he had,
his room would not have been supplied by the Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
but by Them. Besides, if <i>Cyril</i> had been vested with the Character
of the Pope’s Legate, what Occasion had there been to send Three
more? <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Council as-<br/>sembled without the<br/>Approbation of the<br/>Pope.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Bellarmine</i> and <i>Baronius</i> both allow this Council to have been
assembled by the Emperor; but with the previous Approbation, say
they, and by the Advice of <i>Celestine</i>. That the Council was convened
by the Emperor, is past all doubt, it being said, and repeated above
twenty times in the Acts, that <i>they were assembled by the Will of the
most religious Emperors</i>. But of <i>Celestine</i> not the least mention is
ever made by any of the Fathers, not even by <i>Cyril</i>. The above-mentioned
Writers found their Assertion on a Letter of St. <i>Austin</i>, and
on the Acts of St. <i>Petronius</i>. But both these Pieces are now universally
rejected as supposititious.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The whole Dispute<br/>about Words.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>As to the Dispute, which occasioned the assembling of this Council,
the contending Parties seem to have agreed in the Substance, and to have
only quarreled about Words: at least the Emperor thought so, as I have
observed above; and, what is more, <i>Nestorius</i> himself. For in the Letter
which he writ to <i>Celestine</i>, acquainting him with the Resolution <i>Theodosius</i>
had taken of assembling a Council, he only told him, that it was
for some important Affairs of the Church; adding, that as to the Dispute
between him and the Bishop of <i>Alexandria</i>, it was not a Matter of such
mighty Moment, as to require the Decision of an Oecumenical Council.
And truly both <i>Nestorius</i> and <i>Cyril</i>, so far as we can judge
from their own Words, acknowleged One Person in Christ, and Two
Natures, the Natures distinct, but inseparably united; which was the
Catholic Belief. Now the Subject of the Dispute was, whether, in
virtue of that Union between the Human and Divine Nature, the Properties
of the former might, or might not, be ascribed to God, and
those of the latter to Man. The Negative was maintained by <i>Nestorius</i>,
and the Affirmative by <i>Cyril</i>; the one rejecting as blasphemous,
and the other admitting as orthodox, the following Expressions; <i>God
was born</i>, <i>God suffered</i>, <i>God died</i>, Mary <i>was the Mother of God</i>;
which was plainly disputing about Words only, or Expressions. It is
true, <i>Cyril</i> charged <i>Nestorius</i> with the Doctrine of <i>Paul</i> of <i>Samosata</i>,
for rejecting them; and <i>Nestorius</i>, <i>Cyril</i> with that of <i>Apollinaris</i>,
for admitting them; but neither owned the Tenets, that were by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>other ascribed to him: so that <i>Cyril</i> was only a Heretic of <i>Nestorius</i>’s
making, and <i>Nestorius</i> of <i>Cyril</i>’s: <i>Nestorius</i> acknowleged a real
Union between the Two Natures in Christ, and <i>Cyril</i> a real Distinction.
But they did not, and, perhaps, when they were once
warmed with disputing, would not, understand one another. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nestorianism <i>an<br/>imaginary Heresy</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  <i>Nestorianism</i>,
says a modern <i>Roman Catholic</i> Writer<a id='r1632' /><a href='#f1632' class='c015'><sup>[1632]</sup></a>, <i>is but an imaginary
Heresy. Had</i> Nestorius <i>and St.</i> Cyril <i>understood one another,
they had agreed, and prevented the Scandal which their quarreling
brought on the Church. But the</i> Greeks <i>have always been great Disputants;
and it was by them that most of the first Heresies were
broached. The Subject of their Disputes was, generally speaking,
some metaphysical Speculation; and their Method of handling it
arrant Chicanery. From equivocal Terms they drew false Inferences,
and from Inferences passed to Injuries. Thus they became irreconcileable
Enemies, and, forgetting Truth, sought only to hurt one another.
Had they but coolly explained their Thoughts, they had found
that in most Cases no room was left, on either Side, for the Imputation
of Heresy.</i></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nestorius <i>and</i> Cyril<br/><i>agree in the Sub-<br/>stance</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the present Dispute <i>Cyril</i>, the more to oppose, or rather to provoke,
<i>Nestorius</i>, affected to use, on all Occasions, not only the Expressions,
which I have mentioned above, but others that seem to
involve a still more apparent Contradiction; <i>viz.</i> <i>The Eternal was
born in Time, the Impassible suffered, the Immortal died, Life died.</i>
At these Expressions the Orientals were no less shocked than <i>Nestorius</i>;
and therefore separating themselves from the Communion of <i>Cyril</i>,
whom they concluded to have fallen into the Errors of <i>Apollinaris</i>,
they insisted upon his either condemning or explaining the Expressions
he used, before they would admit him to their Communion, or any,
who communicated with him. He chose the latter; and then it appeared,
that they had been all fighting the whole time in the Dark;
for by those Expressions <i>Cyril</i> meant no more, than that Christ, who
was God, was born, suffered, and died; that <i>Mary</i> was the Mother
of Christ, who was God; the very Doctrine and Expressions which
<i>Nestorius</i> had been all along contending for, and <i>Cyril</i> had been
combating with so much Warmth. But <i>Nestorius</i> was already deposed
by the Faction of <i>Cyril</i>, and <i>Maximus</i> chosen and ordained Bishop
of <i>Constantinople</i> in his room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>What meant by the<br/>Communication of<br/>Idioms.</i></div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>The Expressions of <i>Cyril</i> were approved by the Council of <i>Ephesus</i>,
and have therefore been adopted by the Church of <i>Rome</i>. But her
Schoolmen, well apprised of the Objections to which they are liable,
to excuse them from Blasphemy, have been obliged to recur to what
they call a <i>Communication of Idioms</i>, in virtue of which the Properties
of both Natures, say they, may be ascribed to the <i>Hypostasis</i> or
Person, in whom both Natures were united. Thus we may say, according
to them, <i>God was born</i>, <i>God suffered</i>, because the Person,
who was God, <i>was born</i>, and <i>suffered</i>. Thus indeed they excuse the
Expressions of <i>Cyril</i> from Blasphemy: but still it must be owned,
that the Expressions used by <i>Nestorius</i>, <i>Christ was born</i>, <i>Christ suffered</i>,
<i>Christ died</i>, were at least far more proper. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Expressions of</i><br/>Nestorius <i>more pro-<br/>per than those of</i><br/>Cyril.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For, after all, this
<i>Communication of Idioms</i> is, in Fact, nothing else but a rhetorical
Figure: so that <i>Cyril</i> spoke like an Orator, and <i>Nestorius</i> like a
Philosopher: the Expressions of the former were, in a strict
Sense, false and blasphemous; those of the latter, in the strictest
Sense, true and orthodox. Tropes and Figures serve only to disguise
the Truth, to lead Men into Errors, and therefore ought to be laid
aside by all who seriously inquire after Truth, or explain it to others.
I shall conclude with observing, that if by a <i>Communication of Idioms</i>
the Properties of the Human and Divine Nature may be ascribed to
the Person, in whom those two Natures were united; the Properties
of the Body and Soul might, by a like Communication, be ascribed to
the Person, in whom the Body and Soul are united: so that it might
be said, with as much Propriety, <i>Man is immortal</i>, <i>Man will never
die</i>, because the Soul is immortal, and will never die, as <i>God was
mortal</i>, <i>God died</i>, because the Humanity was mortal and died. The
Case is parallel, and the <i>Communication of Idioms</i> must justify both
Expressions, or neither.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>A particular Reason<br/>for rejecting the Title<br/>of</i> Mother of God.</div>

<p class='c001'>As to the Title of <i>Mother of God</i>, to which <i>Nestorius</i> had a
more than ordinary Aversion, he seems to have rejected it on a particular
Account; for the same Reason that induced <i>Clement</i> XI. to
suppress the Title of <i>Grandmother of God</i>, which, in his time, began
to be commonly given to St. <i>Anne</i>; <i>viz.</i> because <i>it was offensive
to pious Ears</i>; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>piarum aurium offensiva</i></span>. If the Virgin <i>Mary</i> was
the Mother, St. <i>Anne</i> was, as properly speaking, the Grandmother
of God. Why then should the Mother be robbed of so glorious
a Title, while the Daughter is suffered to enjoy it? Why should <i>Nestorius</i>
be deemed a Heretic for denying it to the Daughter, rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>than <i>Clement</i> for denying it to the Mother? The one was as offensive
to the Ears of <i>Nestorius</i>, as the other could possibly be to the Ears
of <i>Clement</i>. However, the former did not consult his Ears alone,
but his Reason too, as has been shewn above; whereas the latter
must have consulted his Ears only, there being no Shadow of Reason,
why the one Title should be allowed, and not the other.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Fate of</i> Nestorius.</div>

<p class='c001'>As for <i>Nestorius</i>, he received an Order from the Emperor, while
the Council was still sitting, commanding him to quit <i>Ephesus</i>, and
retire to the Monastery of St. <i>Euprepius</i> in the Suburbs of <i>Antioch</i>,
where he had led a monastic Life before he was raised to the See of
<i>Constantinople</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>He is ordered to re-<br/>turn to his Monastery.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This Order he received with great Joy, having often
declared, that he wished for nothing so much as to spend his Life
in Solitude and Retirement, far from the Troubles that threatened the
Church<a id='r1633' /><a href='#f1633' class='c015'><sup>[1633]</sup></a>. In the Letter, which he writ to <i>Antiochus</i> the <i>Præfectus
Prætorio</i>, by whom the Emperor’s Order was communicated to him,
he told him, that to be thus deposed, for standing up in Defence of
the Orthodox Faith, was a greater Honour than he had ever presumed
to aspire to, or hoped to attain. The only Favour he begged
of <i>Antiochus</i> was, that he would employ his whole Interest at Court,
in order to obtain public Letters of the Emperor, that might be read
in all the Churches, condemning the Doctrine of <i>Cyril</i><a id='r1634' /><a href='#f1634' class='c015'><sup>[1634]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Is banished into</i>Ar-<br/>abia, <i>at the Request<br/>of</i> Celestine, <i>and<br/>the Bishops of his<br/>Party</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The following
Year 432. <i>Celestine</i> writ a very pressing Letter to <i>Theodosius</i>,
dated the 15th of <i>March</i>, conjuring him, as he tendered the Purity
of the Faith, to confine <i>Nestorius</i> to some uninhabited Place, where
it might not be in his Power to infect others with his pestilential
Doctrine; which was begging the Emperor to drive him out, like a
wild Beast, from human Society, to perish in a Desart. He writ, at
the same time, a circular Letter to the Bishops in those Parts, exhorting
them to second him with all their Power and Interest at Court<a id='r1635' /><a href='#f1635' class='c015'><sup>[1635]</sup></a>.
<i>Theodosius</i>, hearkening only to the Impulses of his own Good-nature,
withstood all the Solicitations of <i>Nestorius</i>’s Enemies, for Four Years.
But, in the End, being made to believe, that by shewing Mercy to
such an obstinate Heretic, he rendered himself unworthy of Mercy;
and that to treat him with Severity was the most effectual Means of
drawing down the Blessings of Heaven upon himself, and the Empire;
his Good-nature yielded, and he issued an Order, addressed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span><i>Isidore</i>, then the <i>Præfectus Prætorio</i>, injoining him to cause <i>Nestorius</i>
to be conveyed to <i>Petra</i> in <i>Arabia</i>, to end his Days there, by
way of Atonement for the Mischief he had done. With him were
banished, to the same Place, Count <i>Irenæus</i>, his great Friend and Protector,
and <i>Photius</i>, a Presbyter of <i>Constantinople</i>, who had written in
his Defence against <i>Cyril</i><a id='r1636' /><a href='#f1636' class='c015'><sup>[1636]</sup></a>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Books forbidden,<br/>and ordered to be<br/>burnt.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  The same Year the Emperor issued an
Edict, dated the 30th of <i>July</i>, commanding the Disciples of <i>Nestorius</i>
to be called <i>Simonians</i><a id='rN74' /><a href='#fN74' class='c015'><sup>[N74]</sup></a>; his Books to be everywhere sought
for, and publicly burnt; and all Persons, in whose Possession they
were, to deliver them up to the Magistrates. By the same Edict the
<i>Nestorians</i> were forbidden to hold any Assemblies in the Cities, Villages,
or in the Fields, and the Places were confiscated, where such
Assemblies should be held, as well as the Estates of those who should
frequent them<a id='r1637' /><a href='#f1637' class='c015'><sup>[1637]</sup></a>. This Edict was published both in <i>Greek</i> and in
<i>Latin</i>, that it might be understood by the Subjects of both Empires.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fN74'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN74'>N74</a>. The Emperor ordered them to be
so called, merely to render them odious;
for there was not the least Affinity between
the Heresy of <i>Simon</i> the Magician, and the
Doctrine that was ascribed to <i>Nestorius</i>.
In this <i>Theodosius</i> followed the Example of
his Predecessor <i>Constantine</i>, who to disgrace
the <i>Arians</i>, and prejudice the Populace
against them, ordered them to be called
<i>Porphyrians</i>. For when a Man was once
declared a Heretic, all Means of rendering
him infamous were deemed just and lawful.

<div class='sidenote'><i>Is frequently removed<br/>from one Place to<br/>another.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>The Enemies of <i>Nestorius</i> were not yet satisfied; they thought
his Confinement to <i>Petra</i> too mild a Punishment; and therefore, before
he had been long there, they prevailed upon the Emperor to
remove him from <i>Petra</i> to <i>Oasis</i>, in the Desarts between <i>Egypt</i> and
<i>Libya</i>, a Place to which the greatest Criminals were usually confined
in those Days<a id='r1638' /><a href='#f1638' class='c015'><sup>[1638]</sup></a>. He was still in <i>Oasis</i>, when <i>Socrates</i> wrote, that is,
in 439<a id='r1639' /><a href='#f1639' class='c015'><sup>[1639]</sup></a>. but the Town being soon after surprised by the Barbarians,
named <i>Blemmyes</i>, he was carried by them into Captivity, but
set again at Liberty, and even informed by them, that the Town
would, in a short time, be attacked anew by another Clan of Barbarians.
Upon this Information he withdrew to the City of <i>Panopolis</i>,
and immediately acquainted the Governor of <i>Thebais</i> with the
Motives that had induced him to quit the Place, which he had been
confined to by the Imperial Edict, intreating <i>his Highness</i> (<i>Celsitudinem
tuam</i>) to notify them to the Emperor, and suffer him to continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>there till his Pleasure was known. But the Governor happened
to be a zealous Catholic, or rather a true Courtier; and therefore,
without waiting for the Emperor’s Order, he sent a Band of Soldiers
to convey, or rather to drag him to <i>Elephantine</i>, on the most distant
Borders of his Government. This the Governor seems to have
done on purpose to destroy him, and thereby ingratiate himself both
with the Church, and the Court. For the Soldiers he employed on
this Occasion, were not <i>Romans</i>, but <i>Barbarians</i>; and when they
were got above half-way to <i>Elephantine</i>, they were injoined, by a
Counter-order from him, to bring their Prisoner back to <i>Panopolis</i>
with all possible Expedition. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Treated with great<br/>Barbarity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  As he was hurried on by the merciless
Barbarians, notwithstanding his old Age, the Weakness attending it,
and the Hurts he received from a Fall, he arrived at <i>Panopolis</i>, quite
spent, and so worn out with the Fatigues of that painful Journey, that
no one thought he could outlive it many Days. But the Governor
was impatient to hear the News of his Death; and therefore, before
he could recruit his Strength, quite exhausted by this Journey, he
obliged him to undertake another, ordering him to repair, without
Delay, to a certain Place within the Territory of <i>Panopolis</i>. As he
outlived this Journey too, the Governor, bent on having the Merit
and Glory of destroying the pretended Heresiarch, ordered him immediately
to undertake a Fourth; and this put an End to all his Troubles.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Death.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>  For Nature sinking under the Fatigues he was forced to undergo,

<div class='sidenote'>Nestorius <i>himself a<br/>cruel Persecutor</i>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Such were the Sufferings, such was the End, of the famous <i>Nestorius</i>;
and both reflect no small Disgrace on the Ecclesiastics of those
Times, especially on <i>Celestine</i> and <i>Cyril</i>; for by them this cruel Persecution
was raised, and by them it was carried on; the Laymen being
only the Ministers of their Cruelty and Revenge. Such a Treatment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>was quite undeserved by <i>Nestorius</i>, with respect to his Doctrine,
as I have shewn already, but was not so, it must be owned, in another
respect: for he was himself a most furious Persecutor of all those,
who had the Misfortune to be stigmatized with the Name of Heretics;
and it is not to be doubted, but <i>Cyril</i> would have met with
the same Treatment at his Hands, had his Party prevailed, as he did
at <i>Cyril</i>’s. In the Sermon, which he preached on the very Day of his
Ordination, he thus addressed the Emperor, who was present: <i>Make
the Orthodox Faith, O mighty Prince, reign alone on the Earth;
and I will make you reign in Heaven. Lend me your Assistance to
exterminate the Heretics, and I will lend you mine to exterminate
the</i> Persians<a id='r1641' /><a href='#f1641' class='c015'><sup>[1641]</sup></a>. This was proclaiming War against all who dissented
from him; and the War, thus proclaimed, he began without Loss
of Time, and pursued with the utmost Fury, causing the Imperial
Laws against Heretics to be vigorously executed, and stirring up the
Mob, not only in <i>Constantinople</i>, but in the neighbouring Provinces,
against Dissenters of all Denominations. This occasioned an universal
Confusion, and, in some Places, a great deal of Bloodshed; insomuch
that the Emperor was obliged to interpose his Authority, and protect,
to a certain Degree, as Friends to the State, those whom the Bishop
was for exterminating as Enemies to the Church. I will not presume
to interpret the Severity that was practised upon him, as a Judgment
from Heaven for the Severity which he had practised upon others;
agreeably to those Words of our Saviour, <i>With what Measure ye
mete, it shall be measured to you</i><a id='r1642' /><a href='#f1642' class='c015'><sup>[1642]</sup></a>; but I cannot help looking upon
the Treatment he met with, however severe, as a just and well-deserved
Retaliation; and upon him as a Man altogether unworthy of
our Compassion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The Doctrine of the</i><br/>Jansenists <i>approved<br/>by</i> Celestine.</div>

<p class='c001'>But to return to <i>Celestine</i>: In the Year 431. he writ to the <i>Gallican</i>
Bishops, exhorting them to stand up in Defence of the Doctrine
of St. <i>Austin</i>, and to silence, with their Authority, all who opposed
it: for it was opposed by many, among the rest, by the famous
<i>Cassian</i>, as utterly inconsistent with Merit and Freewill. To this
Letter are commonly annexed Nine Articles concerning Grace and
Freewill; and, in these Articles styled there, <i>The Authorities of the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>and express Terms, the Doctrine of the <i>Jansenists</i>, condemned in

some pretend those Articles to be falsly ascribed to <i>Celestine</i>. But
they have passed for his, ever since the Sixth to the present Century:
they have been placed among his Decrees, by <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i>;
were quoted as his by <i>Petrus Diaconus</i> in 519. by <i>Cresconius</i> an <i>African</i>

<div class='sidenote'>Palladius <i>the First<br/>Bishop of</i> Ireland.</div>

<p class='c001'>The same Year died St. <i>Palladius</i>, the First Bishop of <i>Ireland</i>. He
belonged to the <i>Roman</i> Church, and had been sent by <i>Celestine</i> some
Years before into <i>Britain</i>, to stop the Progress of the <i>Pelagian</i> Heresy
in this Island. From <i>Britain</i> he had passed over into <i>Ireland</i><a id='rN76' /><a href='#fN76' class='c015'><sup>[N76]</sup></a>;
and, having converted there some of the Inhabitants, he returned to
<i>Rome</i>, to beg of <i>Celestine</i>, that a Bishop might be sent thither. <i>Celestine</i>
complied with his Request, ordained him First Bishop of <i>Ireland</i>,
and sent him back into that Island. Thus <i>Prosper</i>, who lived
at this very time[o]. The <i>Irish</i> Writers tell us, that, finding their
Countrymen, whose Conversion was reserved by Heaven for St. <i>Patric</i>,
very obstinate, he abandoned the Island, and died in the Country

<div class='note-container'>

<div class='footnote' id='fN76'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rN76'>N76</a>. <i>Prosper</i> writes, that he was sent <i>ad
Scotos</i>; whence the <i>Scotch</i> Writers conclude
him to have been sent into <i>Scotland</i>,
and the <i>Scots</i> have long looked upon him as
the Apostle of their Nation. But that he
was sent into <i>Ireland</i>, and not into <i>Scotland</i>,
is manifest from <i>Prosper</i>’s own Words.
For speaking of <i>Celestine</i>, by whom <i>Palladius</i>
was sent into <i>Britain</i> to make head
against the <i>Pelagians</i>; <i>while he endeavoured</i>,
says he, <i>to maintain the</i> Roman <i>Island
Catholic, he made a barbarous Island Christian</i><a id='rN76.1' /><a href='#fN76.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
The Island therefore, which he
<i>made Christian</i>, was a different Island from
that of <i>Britain</i>; and consequently could
not be <i>Scotland</i>. The Inhabitants of <i>Ireland</i>
began, as early as the Fourth Century,
to be known by the Name of <i>Scoti</i> or <i>Scots</i>;
so that <i>Scoti</i> and <i>Hiberni</i> were but different
Names of one and the same People. It is
true, that St. <i>Patric</i>, in such of his Writings,
as have been judged by the Critics
the most authentic, seems to distinguish
the <i>Scoti</i> from the <i>Hiberni</i>: but that Distinction
is only with respect to Merit and
Rank; for he speaks constantly of the
former as Men of a superior Rank to the
latter. And indeed the Name <i>Hibernus</i>,
tho’ more antient by many Ages than that
of <i>Scotus</i>, appears to have been in great
Contempt among the neighbouring Nations
in St. <i>Patric</i>’s Time<a id='rN76.2' /><a href='#fN76.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The <i>Hiberni</i>
were perhaps the Mechanics, and the <i>Scoti</i>
the Gentry, or Men who followed more
noble Professions. By the latter was afterwards
founded the Kingdom of <i>Scotland</i>.
<i>Bollandus</i> is of Opinion, that the <i>Hiberni</i>
came originally from <i>Britain</i>, and were the
first Inhabitants of <i>Ireland</i>; and that the

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN77'>N77</a>. The learned Archbishop <i>Usher</i> will
not allow <i>Palladius</i> to have been the First
Bishop of <i>Ireland</i>; alleging against that
Opinion several Fragments out of the Lives
of <i>Irish</i> Saints, some of whom are said to
have been Bishops, and to have converted
many of their own Countrymen, as early
as the Middle of the Fourth Century<a id='rN77.1' /><a href='#fN77.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
From the Fragments he produces I cannot
judge of the Pieces themselves. But <i>Bollandus</i>,
who seems to have perused them,
maintains them to be of no earlier a Date
than the Twelfth Century; and most of
them to be fabulous, which indeed he proves
undeniably by several Passages quoted from
them<a id='rN77.2' /><a href='#fN77.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. And can the Authority of such
Pieces invalidate, or indeed any-ways affect
the Authority of <i>Prosper</i>, who tells us in
express Terms, that <i>Palladius</i> was ordained
by <i>Celestine</i>, <i>the First Bishop of</i> Ireland?
As for what the Primate offers to elude the
Authority of <i>Prosper</i>, it is scarce worthy
of Notice; <i>viz.</i> that the Word <i>Primus</i> is
not to be found in the Edition of that
Writer by <i>Du Chesne</i>. For it is to be
found, as <i>Usher</i> himself owns, in all the
other Editions, and even in <i>Bede</i>, as well as
in every other Author, who has copied
<i>Prosper</i>’s Chronicle.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same Writers tell us, that St. <i>Patric</i> was at <i>Rome</i>, when
<i>Celestine</i> received the News of the Death of <i>Palladius</i>; and that
thereupon he ordained him Bishop, on the 30th of <i>July</i> 432. about

<p class='c001'><i>Celestine</i> did not long outlive <i>Palladius</i>; for he died the following

and <i>Cyril</i> have been sainted, merely in Consideration of their extraordinary

Cruelty to Heretics was now a cardinal Virtue, capable of atoning for
the greatest Crimes. As for <i>Cyril</i>, he had no better Title to that
Honour, than the Monk <i>Ammonius</i>, whom he sainted, and publicly
commended as a holy Martyr, because he died on the Rack for having
attempted, at the Head of Five hundred riotous Monks, to assassinate,

<p class='c001'><a href='#rN78'>N78</a>. <i>The Bishops of</i> Alexandria <i>had begun</i>,
says <i>Socrates</i><a id='rN78.1' /><a href='#fN78.1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, <i>to exceed the Limits
of the Ecclesiastical Power, and intermeddle
in Civil Affairs, imitating therein the Bishop
of</i> Rome, <i>whose sacred Authority had long</i>
<i>since been changed into Dominion and Empire</i>.
The Governors of <i>Alexandria</i>, looking upon
the Increase of the Episcopal Power, as a
Diminution of the Civil, watched all Opportunities
of mortifying the Bishops, in
order to restrain them within the Limits of
the spiritual, and prevent their encroaching
on the temporal Jurisdiction. But <i>Cyril</i>,
from the very Beginning of his Episcopacy,
bid Defiance to the civil Power, acting in
such Manner as shewed but too plainly,
that he would be kept within no Bounds.
For soon after his Installation, he caused,
by his own Authority, the Churches, which
the <i>Novatians</i> were allowed to have in
<i>Alexandria</i>, to be shut up, seized on the
sacred Utensils, and plundering the House
of their Bishop <i>Theopemptus</i>, drove him out
of the City, stript of every thing he possessed[<a id='rN78.2' /><a href='#fN78.2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
Not long after, the <i>Jews</i>, who
were very numerous in <i>Alexandria</i>, having
one Night treacherously murdered several
Christians there, <i>Cyril</i> next Morning, by
Break of Day, put himself at the Head of
the Christian Mob, and without the Knowlege
of the Governor took Possession of
the Synagogue, drove the <i>Jews</i> out of
<i>Alexandria</i>, pillaged their Houses, and allowed
the Christians, who were concerned
with him in the Riot, to appropriate to
themselves all their Effects. This the Governor
highly resented, and not only rebuked
<i>Cyril</i> very severely for thus entrenching
on his Jurisdiction, and usurping a
Power that did not become him; but writ
to the Emperor, complaining of him for
snatching the Sword of Justice from him to
put it into the Hands of the undiscerning
Multitude. This occasioned a Misunderstanding,
or rather an avowed Enmity, between
<i>Cyril</i> and <i>Orestes</i>. With the former
sided the Clergy, the greater Part of the
Mob, and the Monks; with the latter the
Soldiery, and the better Sort of the Citizens.
As the two Parties were strangely
animated against each other, there happened
daily Skirmishes in the Streets of
<i>Alexandria</i>. For the <i>Alexandrians</i>, as <i>Socrates</i>
observes[<a id='rN78.3' /><a href='#fN78.3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and is well known,
were of all People the most seditious and
ungovernable. The Friends of the Governor,
generally speaking, made their Party
good, having the Soldiery on their Side.
But one Day as <i>Orestes</i> was going out in
his Chariot, attended by his Guards, he
found himself very unexpectedly surrounded
by no fewer than Five hundred Monks
come from the Mountains of <i>Nitria</i>. The
Monks were, in those Days, the standing
Army of the Bishops; but are now of
the Popes alone, who being sensible how
serviceable such a formidable Corps might
prove to the Apostolic See, not only
against the Laity, but the Bishops themselves,
exempted them from their Jurisdiction,
and made them immediately dependent
on themselves. But of the monkish
Orders, their Founders and Institutions, I
shall speak at Length on occasion of their
being first taken by the Popes into their
Service. The <i>Nitrian</i> Monks in the Service
of <i>Cyril</i>, having surrounded the Governor’s
Chariot, first dispersed, with several
Vollies of Stones, the small Guard that
attended it, then falling upon him, dangerously
wounded him, and seemed determined
to put an End to the Quarrel between
him and <i>Cyril</i>, by putting an End
to his Life. But the Citizens, alarmed at
his Danger, flew to his Rescue, put the
cowardly Monks to flight at their first
Appearance, and having seized on the
Monk <i>Ammonius</i>, by whom <i>Orestes</i> had
been wounded, delivered him into his
Hands. The Governor, to deter others from
the like Attempts, and to mortify <i>Cyril</i>,
whom he well knew to be at the Bottom of
the Plot, caused the Monk to be tortured
with so much Severity, that he expired on
the Rack. But <i>Cyril</i>, partly out of Spite
to the Governor, and partly to reward the
Zeal, which the Monk had exerted in attempting
to assassinate his Antagonist, caused
him to be honoured as a holy Martyr, under
the Name of <i>Thaumasius</i>, being himself
ashamed to pay him that Honour under
the Name of <i>Ammonius</i>[<a id='rN78.4' /><a href='#fN78.4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
The Partisans of <i>Cyril</i>, alike mortified
and enraged at the Death of <i>Ammonius</i>,
resolved, at all Events, to revenge it; and
the Person they singled out among the
Friends of <i>Orestes</i> to wreak their Rage and
Revenge on, was one, who, of all the Inhabitants
of that populous City, deserved
it the least. This was the famous, and so
much celebrated, <i>Hypatia</i>, the Wonder of
her Age for Beauty, Virtue, and Knowlege.
She kept a public School of Philosophy
in <i>Alexandria</i>, where she was born;
and her Reputation was so great, that not
only Disciples flocked from all Parts to
hear her; but the greatest Philosophers
used to consult her, as an Oracle, with respect
to the most intricate and abstruse
Points of Astronomy, Geometry, and the
<i>Platonic</i> Philosophy, which she was particularly
well versed in[<a id='rN78.5' /><a href='#fN78.5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Tho' she was
very beautiful, and freely conversed with
Men of all Ranks, yet those she conversed
with were so awed by her known Virtue
and Modesty, that none, but one of her
own Disciples, ever presumed to shew in
her Presence the least Symptom of Passion
or Tenderness; and him she soon cured[<a id='rN78.6' /><a href='#fN78.6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.
<i>Orestes</i> entertained the highest Opinion of
her Abilities, often consulted her, as the
other Governors had done before him, and
in all perplexed Cases governed himself by
her Advice. As she was the Person in
<i>Alexandria</i>, whom he most valued, and in
whose Company he took the greatest Delight,
the Friends of <i>Cyril</i>, to wound him
in the most tender and sensible Part, entered
into a Conspiracy to destroy the innocent
Lady, and by her Death deprive
him of that Comfort. This barbarous Resolution
being taken, as she was one Day
returning Home in her Chariot, a Band of
the Dregs of the People, encouraged and
headed by one of <i>Cyril</i>’s Ecclesiastics named
<i>Peter</i>, attacked her in her Chariot, pulled
her violently out of it, and throwing her
on the Ground, dragged her to the great
Church called <i>Cæsareum</i>. There they stript
her naked, and with sharp Tiles, either
brought with them, or found there, continued
cutting, mangling, and tearing her
Flesh, she bearing it with the greatest Firmness
and Constancy, till Nature yielding
to Pain, she expired under their Hands.
Her Death did not satisfy their Rage and
Fury. They tore her Body in Pieces,
dragged her mangled Limbs, with a thousand
Outrages, through all the Streets of
<i>Alexandria</i>, and then, gathering them together,
burnt them in a Place called <i>Cineron</i>[<a id='rN78.7' /><a href='#fN78.7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
Such was the End of the famous
<i>Hypatia</i>, the most learned Person of the
Age she lived in, and one of the best, tho’
not a Christian. Who could believe Christians,
nay, Ecclesiastics, not to say Bishops,
capable in those early Times of such Barbarities?
The Account which I have given
from <i>Socrates</i> of the tragical End of <i>Hypatia</i>,
is confirmed by <i>Damascius</i> in his
Life of <i>Isidorus</i> the Philosopher, written towards
the End of the present Century[<a id='rN78.8' /><a href='#fN78.8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.
He makes <i>Cyril</i> the Author of that barbarous
Murder. But <i>Damascius</i>, say <i>Du Pin</i>
and <i>Tillemont</i>, was a Pagan, and therefore
deserves no Credit. I wish it could not be
made out so easily as it may, that, tho’ a
Pagan, he deserves to be credited on this
Occasion. The Mob was headed, in perpetrating
that horrid Murder, by one of
<i>Cyril</i>’s Ecclesiastics; and I do not find,
that he was ever punished, or even reprimanded,
by his Bishop, on that Score.
When the Emperor was first acquainted by
<i>Orestes</i>, with what had happened, he expressed
the greatest Indignation and a firm
Resolution to punish the Offenders with
the utmost Severity. But <i>Edesius</i>, a Deacon
of the Church of <i>Alexandria</i>, who resided
at <i>Constantinople</i>, with the Character of
<i>Cyril</i>’s Nuncio, having gained over the
Ministers, with the large Sums that were
remitted to him (not by the Mob, or the
Ecclesiastic who headed them; for he was
only a Reader), the Emperor was not only
appeased, but prevailed upon to grant a
general Pardon to all, who were concerned
in that Riot[<a id='rN78.9' /><a href='#fN78.9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. But, by pardoning them,
he drew down Vengeance from Heaven
upon himself, says the Historian, and was
deservedly punished in the Persons of those,
who were most dear to him[<a id='rN78.10' /><a href='#fN78.10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a>. He alludes
perhaps to the unhappy End of <i>Valentinian</i>
III. his Cousin and Son-in-law,
who was murdered on the 17th of <i>March</i>
455. and to the Misfortunes, which the
whole Imperial Family was involved in after
his Death.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Church of <i>Rome</i>, which has sainted
this Man, may think herself concerned in
Honour to justify all his Proceedings; but
surely the Church of <i>England</i> is not. I
shall not therefore attempt such a Vindication;
but having truly and faithfully related
the Facts from a contemporary Historian,
shall leave the Character of <i>Cyril</i> to
be judged of from them, and content myself
with wishing, that one, whose Zeal
for the Christian Religion was sometimes
meritorious, had better understood the true
Bounds of that Zeal, and the true Spirit of
that Religion, than he appears to have
done upon many Occasions.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Thus far the History of the Popes has been merely Ecclesiastical,
and therefore less entertaining: but, in the next Volume, the Affairs
of the Church will begin very soon to be so interwoven with those of
the State, as to render the History both Ecclesiastic and Civil. The
Popes will soon make a very different Figure from that which they
have hitherto made; no longer mere Bishops, but Bishops and Princes;
and the Bishop almost intirely lost in the Prince; no longer contending
only with their Collegues for Spiritual Power and Jurisdiction, but,
at the same time, with the greatest Monarchs for Dominion and
Empire; nay, employing the Sword as well as the Keys, and heading,
as directed by their Ambition or Interest, both Councils and Armies.
We shall see the Western Empire utterly extinct, and <i>Italy</i> successively
invaded, and partly held by the <i>Heruli</i>, by the <i>Goths</i>, by the
<i>Greeks</i>, the <i>Lombards</i>, the <i>French</i>, the <i>Italians</i>, the <i>Germans</i>, and
the <i>Normans</i>; and the Popes managing their Affairs, in all these
Revolutions, with so much Art and Address, as to reap, from most of
them, some considerable Advantage for themselves. Events more
interesting, though, in reality, not more important, than those which
the present Volume relates; and which, to the very End of this
History, will be succeeded by others, equally proper to excite the Attention

<p class='c001'>The system of footnotes is somewhat complicated.  Notes on the main text
are lettered ‘a’ to ‘z’ (skipping ‘j’ and ‘v’), and repeat that pattern from page to page,
beginning anew on each section. These attributive notes nearly always serve simply to
designate sources. There are 78 longer explanatory notes which are lettered
with uppercase characters, always beginning with ‘A’ and only proceeding to
‘B’, etc., if they appear on the same page. These notes are themselves
annotated with internally numbered subnotes.</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>[a]</dt>
    <dd>The lower-case lettered footnotes, used to refer to sources, have been moved to the end
    of each article, and have been resequenced for uniqueness.
    </dd>
    <dt>[A]</dt>
    <dd>The uppercase lettered footnotes, used for supplementary comments, have been moved, when
    necessary, to follow the paragraph where they are referenced. A number of those notes had
    numbered footnotes of their own. These have been kept with the note itself. The
    supplementary notes have been resequenced as well, and prefixed with an ‘N’.
    </dd>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>The numbered subnotes have been renumbered sequentially within the note, including the
    note’s designation, e.g., ‘1’ is the first subnote for the N47 supplemental note.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c001'>The word ‘acknowledge’ appears most regularly as ‘acknowlege’, but the two
instances of the more modern spelling are retained.</p>

<p class='c001'>On p. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>, the anchor for footnote <a href='#r429'>429</a> (‘o’ in the original) is missing.
It has been placed based upon its appearance in other editions.</p>

<p class='c001'>An italic font was used to denote emphasized terms, proper names, non-English words
and phrases, Latin abbreviations, as well as the text of quotations and sidenotes.
Within quoted (and italicized) text, proper names are given in the default font.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spelling and punctuation has been retained, with only a few exceptions. Those
errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and are noted
here. The references are to the page and line in the original. Errors
within footnotes include the page that the note appears on in the original, the
original footnote designation, and the line within the note.</p>

domain material from the Google Books project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
